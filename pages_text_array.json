    "page: 19, manual name: riflecarbine\n20 November 2019\nTC 3-22.9, C3\nix\nIntroduction \nThis manual is comprised of nine chapters and five appendices, and is specifically tailored \nto the individual Soldier’s use of the M4- or M16-series weapon. This TC provides specific \ninformation about the weapon, aiming devices, attachments, followed by sequential chapters \non the tactical employment of the weapon system.  \nThe training circular itself is purposely organized in a progressive manner, each chapter or \nappendix building on the information from the previous section. This organization provides \na logical sequence of information which directly supports the Army’s training strategy for \nthe weapon at the individual level.  \nChapters 1 through 4 describe the weapon, aiming devices, mountable weapons, and \naccessories associated with the rifle and carbine. General information is provided in the \nchapters of the manual, with more advanced information placed in appendix A, Ammunition, \nand appendix B, Ballistics. \nChapters 5 through 9 provide the employment, stability, aiming, control and movement \ninformation. This portion focuses on the Solider skills needed to produce well aimed shots. \nAdvanced engagement concepts are provided in appendix C of this publication. Appendix D \nof this publication provides common tactical drills that are used in training and combat that \ndirectly support tactical engagements. Finally, appendix E of this publication, is provided at \na common location in this and future weapons publications to provide a common location \nfor reference. \nThis manual does not cover the specific rifle or carbine training strategy, ammunition \nrequirements for the training strategy, or range operations. These areas will be covered in \nseparate training circulars. \nConclusion \nTC 3-22.9 applies to all Soldiers, regardless of experience or position.

    "page: 21, manual name: riflecarbine\n20 November 2019\nTC 3-22.9, C3 \n1-1\nChapter 1 \nOverview \nThis TC is designed to provide Soldiers the critical information on \ntheir rifle or carbine to properly and effectively engage and destroy \nthreats in a direct fire engagement. It relies on the Soldier’s \nunderstanding of the weapon, how it functions, its capabilities, the \ncapabilities of the optics and ammunition, and how to properly \nemploy those capabilities to achieve mastery through the \napplication of the functional elements of the shot process. \nThis chapter describes the principles of proper weapons handling, \ntactical applications and control measures for handling the \nweapons, and an overview of the concepts of overmatch as it \npertains to a Soldier’s individual weapon.  \n1-1. \nEach Soldier is responsible for placing accurate and effective fires on threat\ntargets with their individual weapon. This manual defines the functional elements of the\nshot process, the principles of operation of the weapon, the characteristics and\ndescription of ballistics and ammunition, and the various engagement techniques that\nare essential to build Soldier proficiency with their weapon. It includes standard drills\nand techniques that assist the Soldier to build, improve, and sustain their skills to achieve\naccurate and precise shots consistently during combat operations (see figure 1-1).\nFigure 1-1.

    "page: 22, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 1 \n1-2\nTC 3-22.9, C3\n20 November 2019 \nSAFE WEAPONS HANDLING \n1-2. \nSafe weapons handling procedures are a consistent and standardized way for\nSoldiers to handle, operate, and employ the weapon safely and effectively. Weapons\nhandling is built on three components; the Soldier, the weapon, and the environment:\n\nThe Soldier must maintain situational understanding of friendly forces, the\nstatus of the weapon, and the ability to evaluate the environment to properly\nhandle any weapon. The smart, adaptive, and disciplined Soldier is the\nprimary safety mechanism for all weapons under his control.\n\nThe weapon is the primary tool of the Soldier to defeat threats in combat.\nThe Soldier must know of and how to operate the mechanical safeties built\ninto the weapons they employ, as well as the principles of operation for those\nweapons.\n\nThe environment is the Soldier’s surroundings. The Soldier must be aware\nof muzzle discipline, the nature of the target, and what is behind it.\n1-3. \nTo safely and effectively handle weapons, Soldiers must be cognitively aware of\nthree distinct weapons handling measures:\n\nThe rules of firearms safety.\n\nWeapons safety status.\n\nWeapons control status.\n1-4. \nThese measures directly support the components of safe weapons handling. They\nare designed to provide redundant safety measures when handling any weapon or\nweapon system, not just rifles and carbines.\n1-5. \nThis redundancy allows for multiple fail-safe measures to provide the maximum\nlevel of safety in both training and operational environments. A Soldier would have to\nviolate two of the rules of firearms safety or violate a weapon safety status in order to\nhave a negligent discharge.\nNote. Unit standard operating procedures (SOPs), range SOPs, or the \noperational environment may dictate additional safety protocols; however, \nthe rules of firearms safety are always applied. If a unit requires Soldiers to \nviolate these safety rules for any reason, such as for the use of blank rounds \nor other similar training munitions during training, the unit commander must \ntake appropriate risk mitigation actions. \nRULES OF FIREARMS SAFETY \n1-6. \nThe Rules of Firearms Safety are standardized for any weapon a Soldier may\nemploy. Soldiers must adhere to these precepts during training and combat operations,\nregardless of the type of ammunition employed, except as noted above.\n",
    "page: 23, manual name: riflecarbine\nOverview \n20 November 2019\nTC 3-22.9, C3\n1-3\nRule 1: Treat Every Weapon as if it is Loaded \n1-7. \nAny weapon handled by a Soldier must be treated as if it is loaded and prepared\nto fire. Whether or not a weapon is loaded should not affect how a Soldier handles the\nweapon in any instance.\n1-8. \nSoldiers must take the appropriate actions to ensure the proper weapon status is\napplied during operations, whether in combat or training.\nRule 2: Never Point the Weapon at Anything You Do Not Intend to Destroy \n1-9. \nSoldiers must be aware of the orientation of their weapon’s muzzle and what is\nin the path of the projectile if the weapon fires. Soldiers must ensure the path between\nthe muzzle and target is clear of friendly forces, noncombatants, or anything the Soldier\ndoes not want to strike.\n1-10. When this is unavoidable, the Soldier must minimize the amount of time the\nmuzzle is oriented toward people or objects they do not intend to shoot, while\nsimultaneously applying the other three rules of fire arms safety.\nRule 3: Keep Finger Straight and Off the Trigger Until Ready to Fire \n1-11. Soldiers must not place their finger on the trigger unless they intend to fire the\nweapon. The Soldier is the most important safety feature on any weapon. Mechanical\nsafety devices are not available on all types of weapons. When mechanical safeties are\npresent, Soldiers must not solely rely upon them for safe operation knowing that\nmechanical measures may fail.\n1-12. Whenever possible, Soldiers should move the weapon to mechanical safe when a\ntarget is not present. If the weapon does not have a traditional mechanical safe, the\ntrigger finger acts as the primary safety.\nRule 4: Ensure Positive Identification of the Target and its Surroundings \n1-13. The disciplined Soldier can positively identify the target and knows what is in\nfront of and what is beyond it. The Soldier is responsible for all bullets fired from their\nweapon, including the projectile’s final destination.\n1-14. Application of this rule minimizes the possibility of fratricide, collateral damage,\nor damage to infrastructure or equipment. It also prepares the Soldier for any follow-on\nshots that may be required.\n",
    "page: 24, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 1 \n1-4\nTC 3-22.9, C3 \n20 November 2019\nWEAPON SAFETY STATUS \n1-15. The readiness of a Soldier’s weapon is termed as its weapon safety status (WSS).\nIt is a standard code that uses common colors (green, amber, red, and black) to represent\nthe level of readiness for a given weapon.\n1-16. Each color represents a specific series of actions that are applied to a weapon.\nThey are used in training and combat to place or maintain a level of safety relevant to\nthe current task or action of a Soldier, small unit, or group.\n1-17. The WSS ratings are evaluated by the level of safety measures applied to the\nweapon itself. Table 1-1 describes the general safe condition of the weapon for each\nWSS, based on the standard color scheme found in ADP 1-02.\nNote. If the component, assembly, or part described is unclear, refer to the \nweapon’s technical manual (TM) or chapter 2 of this publication. \nTable 1-1. General safe condition of the weapon for each weapon safety \nstatus \n1-18. All firers and leaders must be fluent in the general meaning of each WSS, how it\npertains to the weapon being employed, and the responsibilities of the firer to own each\nshot or burst. The following are the basic definitions for each WSS:\n\nGreen, “Fully Safe” – the weapon is clear, no ammunition is present the\nchamber is empty, and the fire selector switch is set to SAFE.\n\nAmber, “Substantially Safe” – a leader must clear and verify that the\nweapon’s bolt is forward, the chamber is empty, and ammunition is\nintroduced to the weapon. This is an administrative or preparatory WSS.\nLeaders use amber primarily for mounted operations and during combat\noperations when directed to maintain a substantially safe weapon with the\nability to rapidly transition and escalate to red or black, based on the situation.\nNote. WSS amber is not used in the live-fire events described in this \npublication. \n",
    "page: 25, manual name: riflecarbine\nOverview \n20 November 2019 \nTC 3-22.9, C3 \n1-5\n\nRed, “Marginally Safe” – the fire selector switch is set to SAFE, the magazine\nis locked in the magazine well, a round is in the chamber, and the bolt is\nlocked in the forward position.\n\nBlack, “Not Safe” – Indicates when the weapon is fully prepared to fire, the\nfirer has positively identified the target, the fire selector switch is set to FIRE,\nand the firer’s finger is on the trigger, and the fire is in the process of engaging\nthe target.\nNote. WSS black is used to describe the actions of the firer when in a red \nstatus and entering an engagement sequence. WSS black describes the \ndistinct difference between red and actively and deliberately engaging a \nthreat. \n1-19. Figures 1-2 through 1-5 on pages 1-6 through 1-9 describe the standard color code\nfor the M4-series/M16-series rifle and carbine. The Soldier performs actions described\nin figures 1-2 through 1-5 to move from one color code to the next.\n",

    "page: 30, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 1 \n1-10\nTC 3-22.9, C3 \n20 November 2019\nWEAPONS CONTROL STATUS \n1-20. A weapons control status (WCS) is a tactical method of fire control given by a\nleader that incorporates the tactical situation, rules of engagement for the area of\noperations, and expected or anticipated enemy contact. The WCS outlines the target\nidentification conditions under which friendly elements may engage a perceived threat\nwith direct fire.\n1-21. Table 1-2 provides a description of the standard WCS used during tactical\noperations, both in training and combat. They describe when the firer is authorized to\nengage a threat target once the threat conditions have been met.\nTable 1-2. Weapons Control Status \nWEAPONS \nCONTROL STATUS \nDESCRIPTION \nWEAPONS HOLD \nEngage only if engaged or ordered to engage. \nWEAPONS TIGHT \nEngage only if target is positively identified as enemy. \nWEAPONS FREE \nEngage targets not positively identified as friendly. \n1-22. A weapon control status and a weapons safety status are both implemented and\navailable to leaders to prevent fratricide and limit collateral damage. These postures or\nstatuses are typically suited to the area of operation or type of mission and should always\nbe clearly outlined to all Soldiers, typically in the operations order (OPORD), warning\norder (WARNORD), or fragmentary order (FRAGORD).\nOVERMATCH \n1-23. Overmatch is the Soldier applying their learned skills, employing their\nequipment, leveraging technology, and applying the proper force to create an unfair fight\nin favor of the Soldier. To achieve and maintain overmatch against any threat, this\npublication focuses on providing information that develops the Soldier’s direct fire\nengagement skills using the following attributes:\n\nSmart – the ability to routinely generate understanding through changing\nconditions.\n\nFast – the ability to physically and cognitively outmaneuver adversaries.\n\nLethal – deadly in the application of force.\n\nPrecise – consistently accurate in the application of power to ensure deliver\nof the right effects in time, space, and purpose.\n1-24. This requires the Soldier to understand the key elements that build the unfair\nadvantage and exploit them at every opportunity during tactical operations. The\ncomponents of overmatch are:\n",
    "page: 31, manual name: riflecarbine\nOverview \n20 November 2019 \nTC 3-22.9, C3 \n1-11\n\nTarget detection, acquisition, and identification – the ability of the Soldier\nto detect and positively identify any suspected target as hostile at greater\ndistances than their adversary. This relies upon Soldier training and their\nability to leverage the capabilities of their optics, thermals, and sensors.\n\nEngagement range – provide the Soldier with weapons, aiming devices, and\nammunition capable of striking and defeating a threat at a greater range than\nthe adversary can detect or engage the friendly force with effective fires.\n\nLimited visibility – provide the Soldier to make operations during limited\nvisibility an advantage through technology and techniques, and compound\ntheir adversary’s disadvantages during those conditions.\n\nPrecision – provide a weapon and ammunition package that enhances the\nSoldier’s consistent application of shots with a level of precision greater than\nthe adversary’s.\n\nSpeed – the weapon, aiming devices, and accessories a Soldier employs must\nseamlessly work in unison, be intuitive to use, and leverage natural motion\nand manipulations to facilitate rapid initial and subsequent shots during an\nengagement at close quarters, mid-, and extended ranges.\n\nTerminal performance – ensures that precise shots delivered at extended\nranges provide the highest probability to defeat the threat through\nexceptional ballistic performance.\n1-25. Although not a component of overmatch, exceptional training is critical to create\nsmart, fast, lethal, and precise Soldiers. Training builds proficiency in a progressive,\nlogical, and structured manner and provides Soldiers the skills necessary to achieve\novermatch against any adversary. This requires the training program to provide\nexperience to the Soldier in all the components of overmatch to their fullest extent\npossible in the shortest amount of time.\nTARGET DETECTION, ACQUISITION, AND IDENTIFICATION \n1-26. The first component of overmatch at the Soldier level is the ability to detect\ntargets as far away as possible during limited and low visibility conditions. This manual\ndescribes the aiming devices for the service rifle that enhance the Soldier’s target\ndetection and acquisition skills. The Soldier must be able to detect, acquire, and identify\ntargets at ranges beyond the maximum effective range of their weapon and ammunition.\n1-27. This publication also provides key recognition information to build the Soldier’s\nskills in correctly identifying potential targets as friend, foe, or noncombatant (neutral)\nonce detected.\nENGAGEMENT RANGE \n1-28. To ensure small unit success, the Soldier requires weapon systems that can\neffectively engage threats at ranges greater than those of their adversaries. This creates\na standoff distance advantage that allows friendly forces to destroy the target outside the\nthreat’s maximum effective range.\n",
    "page: 32, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 1 \n1-12\nTC 3-22.9, C3 \n20 November 2019\n1-29. Range overmatch provides a tactical engagement buffer that accommodates the\nSoldier’s time to engage with precision fires. For example, a Soldier that has the\ncapability to effectively engage personnel targets at a range of 500 meters will have\nrange overmatch of 10 to 20 percent over a threat rifleman. That 10 to 20 percent range\ndifference is equivalent to a distance of 40 to 80 meters, which is approximately the\ndistance a maneuvering threat can traverse in 15 to 40 seconds.\n1-30. Figure 1-6 portrays the battlefield from the Soldier’s perspective. With mobile,\nmaneuvering threats, the target acquisition capabilities must compliment the\nengagement of those threats at the maximum effective range of the weapon, optic, and\nammunition.\nFigure 1-6. Small unit range overmatch \nLIMITED VISIBILITY \n1-31. Soldiers must be able to detect, acquire, identify, and engage threats in all light\nconditions, regardless of the tactical situation. To provide that capability, aiming devices\nare provided that minimize the effects of limited visibility, but not completely.\n1-32. Image intensifiers and thermal optics provide a significant overmatch capability,\nbut they also have limitations and disadvantages. A general discussion of their\ncapabilities, particularly what those systems can view within the spectrum of light is\nprovided. Soldiers must understand what can be “seen” or viewed and what cannot when\nusing their assigned equipment. Understanding the advantages and limitations of their\nequipment has a direct impact on force protection, fratricide and collateral damage\nprevention, and maintaining overmatch during tactical operations.\nPRECISION \n1-33. The Army standard service rifle is designed with a specific level of accuracy out\nto its maximum effective range. This level of accuracy is more consistent and reliable\n",
    "page: 33, manual name: riflecarbine\nOverview \n20 November 2019 \nTC 3-22.9, C3\n1-13\nthrough the use of magnified aiming devices and superior ammunition. The Soldier must \nbuild the skills to use them effectively to deliver precision fires during tactical \nengagements.  \nSPEED \n1-34. The close fight requires rapid manipulations, a balance of speed and accuracy,\nand very little environmental concerns. Soldiers must move quickly and efficiently\nthrough their manipulations of the fire control to maintain the maximum amount of\nmuzzle orientation on the threat through the shot process. This second-nature efficiency\nof movement only comes from regular practice, drills, and repetition.\n1-35. The foundation of speed of action is built through understanding the weapon,\nammunition, ballistics, and principles of operation of the associated aiming devices. It\nis reinforced during drills (appendix D), and the training program of the unit.\n1-36. The goal of training to overmatch is to increase the speed at which the Soldier\ndetects a threat, identifies it as hostile, and executes the shot process with the desired\ntarget effect. This manual is constructed to provide the requisite information in a\nprogressive manner to build and reinforce Soldier understanding, confidence, and ability\nto execute tactical operations with speed and smooth fluidity of motion.\nTERMINAL BALLISTIC PERFORMANCE \n1-37. Terminal ballistic performance is the actions of a projectile from the time it strikes\nan object downrange until it comes to rest. The ammunition used with the service rifle\nperforms exceptionally well out to its maximum effective range and beyond. This\nmanual provides information on the various munition types available for training and\ncombat, their capabilities and purpose, and the service (combat) round’s terminal\nballistic performance (see appendix A, Ammunition, and appendix B, Ballistics).\n1-38. Soldiers must understand the capabilities of their ammunition, whether designed\nfor training or combat use. That understanding creates a respect for the weapon and\nammunition, reinforces the precepts of safe weapons handling, and an understanding of\nthe appropriate skills necessary to deliver lethal fires.\n1-39. Soldiers that understand the “how” and “why” of their weapon system, aiming\ndevices, ammunition, and procedures work or function develops a more comprehensive\nunderstanding. That level of understanding, coupled with a rigorous training program\nthat builds and strengthens their skills create more proficient Soldiers. The proficiencies\nand skills displayed during training translate into smart, fast, lethal and precise Soldiers\nfor the small unit during decisive action combat operations.\n",

It provides a general overview of the \nmechanics and theory of how weapons operate, key terms and \ndefinitions related to their functioning, and the physical relationship \nbetween the Soldier, the weapon, and the optics/equipment attached \nto the weapon. \nARMY STANDARD SERVICE RIFLE \n2-1. \nThe Army standard service rifle is either the M16-series rifle or M4-series\ncarbine. These weapons are described as a lightweight, 5.56-mm, magazine-fed, gas-\noperated, air-cooled, shoulder-fired rifle or carbine. They fire in semiautomatic (single-\nshot), three-round burst, or in automatic mode using a selector lever, depending on the\nvariant. The weapon system has a standardized mounting surface for various optics,\npointers, illuminators, and equipment, to secure those items with common mounting and\nadjustment hardware.\n2-2. \nEach service rifle weapon system consists of components, assemblies,\nsubassemblies, and individual parts. Soldiers must be familiar with these items and how\nthey interact during operation.\n\nComponents are uniquely identifiable group of fitted parts, pieces,\nassemblies or subassemblies that are required and necessary to perform a\ndistinctive function in the operation of the weapon. Components are usually\nremovable in one piece and are considered indivisible for a particular\npurpose or use.\n\nAssemblies are a group of subassemblies and parts that are fitted to perform\nspecific set of functions during operation, and cannot be used independently\nfor any other purpose.\n\nSubassemblies are a group of parts that are fitted to perform a specific set of\nfunctions during operation. Subassemblies are compartmentalized to\ncomplete a single specific task. They may be grouped with other assemblies,\nsubassemblies and parts to create a component.\n\nParts are the individual items that perform a function when attached to a\nsubassembly, assembly, or component that serves a specific purpose.\n2-3. \nEach weapon consists of two major components: the upper receiver and the lower\nreceiver. These components are described below including their associated assemblies,\nsubassemblies, and parts.\n",

The upper receiver consists of the\nfollowing (see figure 2-1):\n\nBarrel assembly.\n\nBarrel. The bore and chamber of the barrel are chrome-plated to reduce\nwear and fouling over the life of the weapon.\n\nFlash hider or compensator. Located at the end of the barrel, is\nprovided to reduce the signature of the weapon during firing and reduce\nbarrel movement off target during firing.\n\nSling swivel. The attachment hardware for the sling system used to\nproperly carry the weapon.\n\nFront sight assembly. Includes an adjustable front sight post that\nfacilitates zeroing the weapon, serves as the forward portion of the iron\nsight or back up iron sight, and assists with range determination.\n\nAdapter rail system (ARS). Provided in varying lengths, depending on\nthe variant applied. Used to attach common aiming devices or\naccessories.\n\nSlip ring. Provides a spring loaded locking mechanism for the weapon’s\nhand guards.\n\nEjection port. Provides an opening in the upper receiver to allow\nammunition or spent casing ejection from the weapon.\n\nEjection port cover. Provides a dust cover for the ejection port,\nprotecting the upper receiver and bolt assembly from foreign objects.\n\nForward assist assembly.

Provides the trigger, pins, springs, and other mechanical\ncomponents necessary to fire the weapon.\n\nBolt catch. A mechanical lever that can be applied to lock the bolt to the rear\nby the Soldier, or automatically during the cycle of function when the\nmagazine is empty (see page 2-4).\n\nRifle grip. An ambidextrous pistol-type handle that assists in recoil\nabsorption during firing.\n\nMagazine catch assembly. Provides a simple, spring-loaded locking\nmechanism to secure the magazine within the magazine well. Provides the\noperator an easy to manipulate, push-to-release textured button to release the\nmagazine from the magazine well during operation.\n\nButtstock assembly. Contains the components necessary for proper\nshoulder placement of the weapon during all firing positions, returning the\nbolt assembly to battery, and managing the forces of recoil during operation.\n\nThe M4-/M4A1-series carbine has a four position collapsible buttstock\nassembly: Closed, ½ open, ¾ open, and fully-open.\n\nM16-series rifles have a fixed buttstock with cleaning kit compartment\nor an applied modified work order (MWO) collapsible buttstock.\n\nAction spring. Provides the stored energy to return the bolt carrier assembly\nback into battery during operation.\n\nLower receiver extension.

The information provided below is specific to the cycle of function as it \npertains specifically to the M4- and M16-series weapons. \n2-9. \nThe cycle starts when the rifle is ready with the bolt locked to the rear, the \nchamber is clear, and a magazine inserted into the magazine well with at least one \ncartridge. From this state, the cycle executes the sequential phases of the cycle of \nfunctioning to fire a round and prepare the weapon for the next round. The phases of the \ncycle of function in order are— \n \nFeeding. \n \nChambering. \n \nLocking. \n \nFiring. \n \nUnlocking. \n \nExtracting. \n \nEjecting. \n \nCocking. \n2-10. For the weapon to operate correctly, semiautomatic and automatic weapons \nrequire a system of operation to complete the cycle of functioning. The M4- and \nM16-series weapons use a direct impingement gas operating system. This system uses \na portion of the high pressure gas from the cartridge being fired to physically move the \nassemblies and subassemblies in order to complete the cycle of function. \n",

Cooling is the process of dissipating heat from the weapon during firing.\nAlthough not part of the cycle of functioning, cooling the weapon during firing is critical\nto ensure the weapon continues to operate efficiently. Firing a round generates heat and\npressure within the chamber and bore, which radiates outward through the metal of the\nbarrel.\n2-20. The temperature generated by the burning of propellant powders is over one\nthousand degrees Fahrenheit. Some of the heat produced during firing is retained in the\nchamber, bore, and barrel during firing and poses a significant hazard to the firer.\n2-21. How this heat is absorbed by the weapon and dissipated or removed, is a function\nof engineering and design. Lightweight weapons like the M4 and M16 do not have\nsufficient mass to withstand thermal stress efficiently. The weapon system must have a\nmeans to radiate the heat outward, away from the barrel to allow continuous firing.\n2-22. There are three methods to reduce the thermal stress on a weapon. The M4- and\nM16-series of weapons use all three of these methods to varying degrees to cool the\nchamber, bore, and barrel to facilitate continuous operation. These methods of cooling\nare—\n\nRadiational cooling – allows for the dissipation of heat into the surrounding\ncooler air. This is the least efficient means of cooling, but is common to most\nsmall arms weapons, including the rifle and carbine.\n\nConduction cooling – occurs when a heated object is in direct physical\ncontact with a cooler object. Conduction cooling on a weapon usually results\nfrom high chamber operating temperatures being transferred into\nsurrounding surfaces such as the barrel and receiver of the weapon. The\ntransfer from the chamber to the cooler metals has the net effect of cooling\nthe chamber. Thermal energy is then carried away by other means, such as\nradiant cooling, from these newly heated surfaces.\n\nConvection cooling – requires the presence of a moving air current. The\nmoving air has greater potential to carry away heat. The hand guards and\nARS of the rifle and carbine are designed to facilitate air movement. The\nheat shield reflects heat energy away from the hand guard and back towards\nthe barrel. The net effect is an updraft that brings the cooler air in from the\nbottom. This process establishes a convection cycle as heated air is\ncontinually replaced by cooler air.\n2-23. Soldiers should be aware of the principles of the weapon’s cooling methods’\ndirect effects on their line of sight when viewing a target through an aiming device.\nDissipating heat along the length of the barrel can create a mirage effect within the line\nof sight which can cause a significant error to the true point of aim when using magnified\noptics.\n",

Soldiers must be \nfamiliar with the various aiming devices, how they operate, and how \nto employ them correctly to maximize their effectiveness. This \nchapter provides the principles of operation of the most widely \navailable aiming devices, and provides general information \nconcerning their capabilities, function and use. \n3-1. \nAn aiming device is used to align the Soldier, the weapon, and the target to make\nan accurate and precise shot. Each aiming device functions in a different manner. To\nemploy the weapon system to its fullest capability, the Soldier must understand how\ntheir aiming devices function.\n3-2. \nThe following aiming devices are described within this chapter:\n\nIron. Iron represent the various types of mechanical sighting systems\navailable on the weapon. They are available in two distinct types:\n\nIron sights (rear aperture and front sight post).\n\nBack up iron sights (BUIS).\n\nOptics. These are optics predominantly for day firing, with limited night\ncapability. The optics found within this manual come in two types:\n\nClose Combat Optic (CCO).\n\nRifle Combat Optic (RCO, previously referred to as the Advanced\nCombat Optic Gunsight or ACOG).\n\nThermal. These are electronic sighting systems that provide a view of the\nfield of view (FOV) based on temperature variations. There are numerous\nvariants of thermal optics, but are grouped into one type:\nThermal Weapon Sight (TWS). \n\nPointer/Illuminator/Laser. These aiming devices use either a laser beam,\nflood light, or other light to aim the weapon at the target. There are three\ntypes of pointers, illuminators, and lasers used by the service rifle:\n\nAdvanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Light (ATPIAL).\n\nDual Beam Aiming Laser–Advanced (DBAL-A2).\n\nIlluminator, Integrated, Small Arms (STORM).\n",

These two different units are commonly used terms to describe \na measurement of accuracy when firing a weapon, system, or munition. They typically \ninclude the accuracy of a specific weapon, the performance of ammunition, and the \nability of a shooter as it relates to firing the weapon. \nMINUTE OF ANGLE \n3-4. \nA minute of angle (MOA) is an angular unit of measurement equal to 1/60th of a \ndegree (see figure 3-1). The most common use of MOA is when describing the distance \nof change required when zeroing a weapon.  \n3-5. \nOne MOA equals 1.047 inches per 100 yards. For most applications, a Soldier \ncan round this to 1 inch at 100 yards or 1.1 inches at 100 meters to simplify their \narithmetic.  \n \nFigure 3-1. Minute of angle example \n \n \n",

The stadia reticle (sometimes referred to as “stadiametric” or\n“choke sight”) can provide approximate range to target information using width or\nheight of a viewed dismounted target using standard threat dimensions (see figure 3-4).\nFigure 3-4. Stadia reticle example \n3-10. There are two stadia reticles found on the rifle / carbine reticle within the thermal\nweapons sight; vertical and horizontal.\n\nVertical stadia. At the lower left of the sight picture, Soldiers can evaluate\nthe range to target of a standing dismounted threat.\n\nHorizontal stadia. In the upper right portion of the sight picture, Soldiers\ncan evaluate the range to target of an exposed dismounted threat based on the\nwidth of the target.\n",

A major concern for the planning and use of thermal and other optics to aid in the \ndetection process is understanding how they function, but more appropriately, what they \ncan “see”. Each device develops a digital representation of the scene or view it is \nobserving based on what frequencies or wavelengths it can detect within the \nelectromagnetic spectrum. (Note: Thermal devices see differences in heat.) \n \nThermal optics. This equipment operates in the mid- and far-wavelength of \nthe infrared band, which is the farthest of the infrared wavelengths from \nvisible light. Thermal optics cannot translate (“see”) visible light. Thermal \noptics cannot “see” infrared equipment such as infrared (IR) strobe lights, IR \nchemical lights, illuminators, or laser pointers. They can only identify \nemitted radiation in the form of heat (see figure 3-5 on page 3-7).  \n \nImage intensifiers (I2). This equipment, such as night vision devices, use \nthe near area of the infrared spectrum closest to the frequencies of visible \nlight, as well as visible light to create a digital picture of the scene. These \nsystems cannot “see” or detect heat or heat sources. \n3-12. These sights generally operate on the principles of convection, conduction, and \nradiation (mentioned in chapter 2 of this publication). The sight “picks up” or translates \nthe IR wavelength (or light) that is emitted from a target scene through one of those \nthree methods.  \n3-13. Things to be aware of (planning considerations) with these optics are that they \nhave difficulty imaging through the following: \n \nRain – absorbs the IR emitted by the target, makes it difficult to see. \n \nWater – acts as a mirror and generally reflects IR, providing a false thermal \nscene. \n \nGlass – acts similar to water, interfering with the sensor’s ability to \naccurately detect emitted radiation behind the glass. \n3-14. Situations where IR can see better are the following:  \n \nSmoke – will not obscure a target unless the chemical obscurant is extremely \nhot and dense, or if the target is sitting on top of the smoke source. \n \nDust – may interfere with the accurate detection of the emitted thermal \nsignature due to dust and debris density between the sensor and the target \nscene. Dust typically does not obscure the IR signature unless its temperature \nis similar to the target's. \n3-15. Figure 3-5 depicts the areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. It details the various \nwavelengths within the spectrum where the aiming devices, night vision devices, and \nequipment operate. It illustrates where these items can and cannot “see” the others, \nrespectively, within their operating range. \n",

Optics are sighting aids for rifles and carbines that provide enhanced aim point \nreticles, and may include magnified fields of view. Optics are specific to day operations, \nalthough may be used during limited visibility or night operations. They do not have any \nmethod of enhancing low light conditions. \n3-17. Optics enhance the Soldier’s ability to engage targets accurately and at extended \nranges (see figure 3-6 on page 3-9). The available optics for mounting on the M4- and \nM16-series modular weapon system are: \n \nIron Sight. \n \nBack Up Iron Sight (BUIS). \n \nCCO, M68. \n \nRCO, M150. \nIRON SIGHT \n3-18. Some versions of the M4 and M16 come with a carrying handle with an integrated \nrear aperture. The carrying handle may or may not be removable, depending on the \nversion of the service rifle.  \n3-19. The integrated rear aperture includes adjustments for both azimuth (wind) and \nelevation. Specific instructions for zeroing these aiming devices are found in the \nrespective weapon’s technical manual. \n3-20. The carrying handle has two selectable apertures for the engagement situation: \n \nSmall aperture. Used for zeroing procedures and for mid- and extended-range \nengagements. \n \nLarge aperture. Used during limited visibility, close quarters, and for moving \ntargets at close or mid-range. \n3-21. The iron sight uses the fixed front sight post to create the proper aim. Soldiers use \nthe front sight post centered in the rear aperture. The following information is extracted \nfrom the weapon’s technical manual. \n \n \n",

The close combat optic (CCO), M68 is a non-telescopic (unmagnified) reflex\nsight that is designed for the “eyes-open” method of sighting (see figure 3-8). It provides\nSoldiers the ability to fire with one or two eyes open, as needed for the engagement\nsequence in the shot process.\n3-25. The CCO provides a red-dot aiming point using a 2 or 4 MOA diameter reticle,\ndepending on the variant. The red dot aiming point follows the horizontal and vertical\nmovement of the firer’s eye, allowing the firer to remain fixed on the target. No centering\nor focusing on the front sight post is required. There are three versions of the CCO\navailable in the force.\nNote. Re-tighten the torque-limiting knob after firing the first three to five \nrounds to fully seat the M68.  \n3-26. The CCO is zeroed to the weapon. It must remain matched with the same weapon,\nattached at the same slot in the attached rail system or be re-zeroed. If the CCO must be\nremoved for storage, Soldiers must record the serial number and the rail slot to retain\nzero.\nNote. The weapon must be re-zeroed if the CCO is not returned to the same \nrail slot on the adaptive rail system. \nAdvantages \n3-27. The CCO offers a distinct speed advantage over iron sights in most if not all\nengagements. The adjustments on brightness allow the Soldier to have the desired\nbrightness from full daylight to blackout conditions.\n3-28. The CCO is the preferred optic for close quarter’s engagements.\nDisadvantages \n3-29. The CCO lacks a bullet drop compensator or other means to determine accurate\nrange to target beyond 200m.\n3-30.

The RCO (see figure 3-9) is designed to provide enhanced target identification\nand hit probability for the M4-/M4A1- or M16-series weapon.\n3-32. There are several versions of the RCO available for use across the force. Soldiers\nmust be familiar with their specific version of their assigned RCO, and be\nknowledgeable on the specific procedures for alignment and operation (see figure 3-9\nfor RCO azimuth and elevation adjustments).\n3-33. The reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges to 800\nmeters using the bullet drop compensator (BDC) (see figure 3-10 on page 3-15). It is\ndesigned with dual illuminated technology, using fiber optics for daytime employment\nand tritium for nighttime and low-light use.\n3-34. The RCO is a lightweight, rugged, fast, and accurate 4x power optic scope\nspecifically designed to allow the Soldier to keep both eyes open while engaging targets\nand maintain maximum situational awareness.\nAdvantages \n3-35. The bullet drop compensator (BDC) is accurate for extended range engagements\nusing either M855 or M855A1 ball ammunition. The ballistic difference between the\ntwo rounds is negligible under 400 meters and requires no hold determinations.\n3-36. This is a widely fielded optic that is rugged, durable, and operates in limited light\nconditions. The self-illuminating reticle allows for continuous operations through end\nevening nautical twilight (EENT).\nDisadvantages \n3-37. This optic’s ocular view is limited when engaging targets in close quarters\nengagements. This requires additional training to master the close quarter’s skills while\nemploying the RCO to achieve overmatch against the threat.\n3-38. The RCO reticle does not include stadia lines. Windage must be applied by the\nshooter from a determined estimate. The RCO has a specific eye relief of 70-mm\n(millimeter) or 1.5 inches. If the eye relief is not correct, the image size will be reduced.\n3-39. The fiber optic illuminator element can provide excessive light to the reticle\nduring certain conditions that produce a glare. The RCO does not have a mechanical or\nbuilt in method to reduce the effects of the glare created. The increased lighting may\ninterfere with the shooter’s point of aim and hold determinations. Soldiers may use\nalternate methods to reduce the glare by reducing the amount of fiber optic exposed to\ndirect sunlight during operating conditions.\n3-40.

Thermal sights are target acquisition and aiming sensors that digitally replicate\nthe field of view based on an estimation of the temperature. They use advanced forward-\nlooking infrared technology that identify the infrared emitted radiation (heat) of a field\nof view, and translate those temperatures into a gray- or color-scaled image. The TWS\nis capable of target acquisition under conditions of limited visibility, such as darkness,\nsmoke, fog, dust, and haze, and operates effectively during the day and night.\n3-42. The TWS is composed of five functional groups:  (See figure 3-10.)\n\nObjective lens – receives IR light emitting from an object and its\nsurroundings. The objective lens magnifies and projects the IR light.\n\nDetector assembly – senses the IR light and coverts it to a video signal.\n\nSensor assembly – the sensor electronics processes the video for display on\nthe liquid crystal display (LCD) array in the field of view.\n\nLCD array/eyepiece – the LCD array provides the IR image along with the\nreticle selected. The light from the LCD array is at the eyepiece.\n\nUser controls – the control electronics allows the user to interface with the\ndevice to adjust contrast, thermal gain, sensitivity, reticle display, and\nmagnification.\nFigure 3-10. Thermal weapon sight example \n3-43. A small detector used in thermal sensors or optics to identify IR radiation with\nwavelengths between 3 and 30 μm (micrometer). The thermal optic calculates and\nprocesses the thermal scene into a correlating video image signal based on the\ntemperature identified.

There are several versions of weapons thermal sights (WTS) available for use\nacross the force. Soldiers must be familiar with their specific model and version of their\nassigned weapon thermal sight, and be knowledgeable on the specific procedures for\nalignment and operation. The various models and versions are identified in their official\nmodel nomenclature:\n\nVersion 1 (v1) – Light Weapons Thermal Sight (LWTS).\n\nVersion 2 (v2) – Medium Weapons Thermal Sight (MWTS).\n\nVersion 3 (v3) – Heavy Weapons Thermal Sight (HWTS).\n3-45. Weapons thermal sights are silent, lightweight, and compact, and have durable\nbattery-powered IR imaging sensors that operate with low battery consumption. (See\nfigure 3-11.)\nAdvantages \n3-46. Military grade weapon thermal weapon sights are designed with the following\nadvantages:\n\nSmall and lightweight.\n\nReal-time imagery. Devices provide real-time video of the thermal scene\nimmediately after power on.\n\nLong-lasting battery life. Low power consumption over time.\n\nReliable. Long mean time between failures (MTBF).\n\nQuiet. The lack of a cooling element allows for a very low operating noise\nlevel.\n\nOne optic fits on multiple weapons. The use of the ARS rail mounting bracket\nallows for the same optic to be used on other weapons.\n\nThe F- and G-models attach in front of other aiming devices to improve their\ncapabilities and eliminate the zeroing procedures for the device.\nDisadvantages \n3-47. These devices have limitations that Soldiers should take into consideration,\nparticularly during combat operations. The primary disadvantages are:\n\nCannot interpret (“see”) multispectral infrared. These systems view a specific\nwavelength for emitted radiation (heat variations), and do not allow viewing\nof all aiming and marking devices at night.\n\nReliance on rechargeable batteries and charging stations. Although the\nbatteries are common and have a relatively long battery life, additional\nequipment is required to charge them. If common nonrechargeable (alkaline)\nbatteries are used, a separate battery adapter is typically required.\n\nCannot interpret thermal signatures behind glass or water effectively.\n\nThermal systems cannot always detect friendly marking systems worn by\ndismounts.\n",

Pointers, illuminators, and laser devices for small arms weapons emit a \ncollimated beam of IR light for precise aiming and a separate IR beam for illumination. \nThese devices operate in one single mode at a time, as selected by the user. The laser is \nactivated by a selector switch on the device or by a remote mechanism installed on the \nweapon. The basic two modes or functions are: \n \nPointer. When used as a pointer or aiming device, a small, pin-point beam \nis emitted from the device. The IR beam provides an infrared visible point \nwhen it strikes an object or target. The IR beam operates in the 400 to 800 \nnanometer wavelength and can only be seen by I2 optics, such as the \nAN-PVS-7 or -14 night vision devices. \n \nIlluminator. Typically used to illuminate a close quarters area as an infrared \nflood light. The illuminator provides a flood-light effect for the Soldier when \nused in conjunction with I2 night vision devices. \nNote. Laser is an acronym for light amplified stimulated emitted radiation, \nbut is predominantly used as a proper noun. \n3-50.

AN/PEQ-2 aiming devices are Class IIIb laser devices that emit a collimated\nbeam of IR light for precise aiming and a separate IR beam for illumination of the target\nor target area (see figure 3-14 on page 3-21). Both beams can be independently zeroed\nto the weapon and to each other. The beams can be operated individually or in\ncombination in both high and low power settings.\nNote. The IR illuminator is equipped with an adjustable bezel to vary the size \nof the illumination beam based on the size and distance of the target. \n3-52. The aiming devices are used with night observation devices (NODs) and can be\nused as handheld illuminators/pointers or mounted on the weapon with the included\nbrackets and accessory mounts. In the weapon-mounted mode, the aiming devices can\nbe used to direct fire and to illuminate and designate targets.\n3-53. The aiming light is activated by pressing on either the ON/OFF switch lever, or\nthe button on the optional cable switch. Either switch connects power from two AA\nbatteries to an internal electronic circuit which produces the infrared laser. Internal\nlenses focus the infrared light into a narrow beam. The direction of the beam is\ncontrolled by rotating the mechanical Adjusters with click detents. These adjusters are\nused to zero the aiming light to the weapon.\n3-54. Once zeroed to the weapon, the aiming light projects the beam along the line of\nfire of the weapon.

The attachments can be applied in various locations on \nthe weapon system. Soldiers must understand what the attachments \nare, how they are correctly positioned, how to align them with the \nweapon system, and how to integrate them into use to maximize the \nsystem’s capabilities.  \nThis chapter explains how the ARS is used to mount the various \nattachments. It describes the weapons, aiming devices, and \naccessories available for mounting, and includes general \ninformation on the proper mounting location as well as their basic \ncapabilities.  \nADAPTIVE RAIL SYSTEM \n4-1. \nThe ARS and rail grabbers are designed for M16- and M4-/M4A1-series weapons\nto mount:\n\nWeapons.\n\nAiming devices.\n\nAccessories.\n4-2. \nThe ARS provides a secure mounting point for various accessories that may be\nmounted on the weapon's top, bottom, left, and right. Each rail groove has an incremental\nnumber identifying the slot location, starting from the rear of the weapon.\n4-3. \nSoldiers should record the attachment or equipment’s serial number (if\napplicable), the location of the attachment (for example, markings between lugs), and\nany boresight or alignment settings specific to the equipment at that location.\n4-4. Once complete, the Soldier should mark the mounting bracket to identify the\ntightened position with a permanent marker. Marking the mounting bracket allows for\nrapid identification of loosening hardware during firing. Soldiers must periodically\nverify the mounting hardware does not loosen during operation. During zeroing or zero\nconfirmation operations, Soldiers should retighten the mounting hardware after the first\nfive rounds.\n4-5. \nSoldiers must ensure the equipment is firmly affixed to the ARS before tie down\nis complete. If the attachments are loose, their accuracy and effectiveness will be\ndegraded.\n",

Mountable accessories are items that may be attached to a weapon but are not \nrequired for operation. They provide assistance stabilizing the weapon or provide white-\nlight illumination for specific tactical operations. \n4-15. These devices are authorized as needed by the small unit. Some mountable \naccessories are aftermarket (commercial-off-the-shelf, or COTS) items that use the ARS \nfor semipermanent attachment. \nBIPOD \n4-16. Bipods are highly adjustable that enhance stability within the battle space \nenvironment. They are secured by the front sling swivel or the advanced rail system on \nthe foregrip of the weapon. They can be used in combination with a sand sock or other \nbuttstock support to provide an extremely stable firing platform. (See figure 4-4.) \n4-17. The bipod is an additional means to stabilize the weapon in various shooting \npositions. Despite primarily being used in prone position, bipods can be used for \nadditional support in alternate shooting positions while using barricade supports. The \nbipod provides additional support which facilitates acquisition of muscle relaxation and \nnatural point of aim. The use of bipods in barricade shooting can increase the Soldier's \nefficiency and probability of a first round hit while engaging targets. \n \nFigure 4-4. Bipod example \n \n \n",

Vertical foregrips (VFGs) assist in transitioning from target to target in close \nquarter combat. (See figure 4-5.) \n4-19. The further out the Soldier mounts the VFG, the smoother and quicker his \ntransitions between multiple targets will be, however he should not mount it so far \nforward that using the VFG is uncomfortable. \n \nFigure 4-5. Vertical foregrip example \nFOREGRIP WITH INTEGRATED BIPODS \n4-20. VFGs with integrated bipods are acceptable for common use. They combine the \nVFG capability with a small, limited adjustment bipod. They typically lack the full \nadjustment capabilities of full bipods, but provide a compact stable extrusion for the \nfirer.  \nMOUNTED LIGHTS \n4-21. The weapon-mounted lights are commonly issued throughout the Army. The \npurpose of the weapon mounted lights is to provide illumination and assist in target \nacquisition and identification during limited visibility operations. \n4-22. Most weapon mounted lights provide selection between white light and infrared \ncapabilities. Employment of the weapon mounted light is based upon mission, enemy, \nterrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, civil considerations \n(METT-TC) and unit SOP. The weapon mounted lights should be mounted in such a \nmanner that the Soldier can activate and deactivate them efficiently and their placement \ndoes not hinder the use of any other attachment or accessory. They must be attached in \nsuch a manner as to prevent negligent or unintentional discharge of white light \nillumination during movement or climbing. \n \n \n \n",
    "page: 83, manual name: riflecarbine\n \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n5-1 \nChapter 5 \nEMPLOYMENT \nThe rifleman’s primary role is to engage the enemy with well-aimed \nshots. (Refer to ATP 3-21.8 for more information.) In this capacity, \nthe rate of fire for the M4 rifle is not based on how fast the Soldier \ncan pull the trigger. Rather, it is based on how fast the Soldier can \nconsistently acquire and engage the enemy with accuracy and \nprecision. \nConsistently hitting a target with precision is a complex interaction \nof factors immediately before, during, and after the round fires. \nThese interactions include maintaining postural steadiness, \nestablishing and maintaining the proper aim on the target, \nstabilization of the weapon while pressing the trigger, and adjusting \nfor environmental and battlefield conditions.  \n5-1. \nEvery Soldier must adapt to the firing situation, integrate the rules of firearms \nsafety, manipulate the fire control, and instinctively know when, how, and where to \nshoot. It is directly influenced by the Soldier’s ability to hit the target under conditions \nof extreme stress: \n \nAccurately interpret and act upon perceptual cues related to the target, front \nand rear sights, rifle movement, and body movement. \n \nExecute minute movements of the hands, elbows, legs, feet, and cheek. \n \nCoordinate gross-motor control of their body positioning with fine-motor \ncontrol of the trigger finger. \n5-2. \nRegardless of the weapon system, the goal of shooting remains constant: well-\naimed shots. To achieve this end state there are two truths. Soldier’s must—  \n \nProperly point the weapon (sight alignment and sight picture). \n \nFire the weapon without disturbing the aim. \n5-3. \nTo accomplish this, Soldiers must master sight alignment, sight picture, and \ntrigger control. \n \nSight alignment – sight alignment is the relationship between the aiming \ndevice and the firer’s eye. To achieve proper and effective aim, the focus of \nthe firer’s eye needs to be on the front sight post or reticle. The Soldier must \nmaintain sight alignment throughout the aiming process. \n \nSight picture – the sight picture is the placement of the aligned sights on the \ntarget. \n \nTrigger control – the skillful manipulation of the trigger that causes the rifle \nto fire without disturbing the aim.  \n",
    "page: 84, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 5 \n5-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nSHOT PROCESS \n5-4. \nThe shot process is the basic outline of an individual engagement sequence all \nfirers consider during an engagement, regardless of the weapon employed. The shot \nprocess formulates all decisions, calculations, and actions that lead to taking the shot. \nThe shot process may be interrupted at any point before the sear disengaging and firing \nthe weapon should the situation change. \n5-5. \nThe shot process has three distinct phases:  \n \nPre-shot. \n \nShot. \n \nPost-shot.  \n5-6. \nTo achieve consistent, accurate, well-aimed shots, Soldiers must understand and \ncorrectly apply the shot process. The sequence of the shot process does not change, \nhowever, the application of each element vary based on the conditions of the \nengagement.  \n5-7. \nEvery shot that the Soldier takes has a complete shot process. Grouping, for \nexample, is simply moving through the shot process several times in rapid succession.  \n5-8. \nThe shot process allows the Soldier to focus on one cognitive task at a time. The \nSoldier must maintain the ability to mentally organize the shot process’s tasks and \nactions into a disciplined mental checklist, and focus their attention on activities which \nproduce the desired outcome; a well-aimed shot.  \n5-9. \nThe level of attention allocated to each element during the shot process is \nproportional to the conditions of each individual shot. Table 5-1 provides an example of \na shot process.  \nTable 5-1.

    "page: 85, manual name: riflecarbine\nEmployment \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n5-3 \nFUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS OF THE SHOT PROCESS \n5-10. Functional elements of the shot process are the linkage between the Soldier, the \nweapon system, the environment, and the target that directly impact the shot process and \nultimately the consistency, accuracy, and precision of the shot. When used \nappropriately, they build a greater understanding of any engagement.  \n5-11. The functional elements are interdependent. A accurate shot, regardless of \nweapon system, requires the Soldier to establish, maintain, and sustain—  \n \nStability – the Soldier stabilizes the weapon to provide a consistent base to \nfire from and maintain through the shot process until the recoil pulse has \nceased. This process includes how the Soldier holds the weapon, uses \nstructures or objects to provide stability, and the Soldier’s posture on the \nground during an engagement. \n \nAim – the continuous process of orienting the weapon correctly, aligning the \nsights, aligning on the target, and the appropriate lead and elevation (hold) \nduring a target engagement. \n \nControl – all the conscious actions of the Soldier before, during, and after \nthe shot process that the Soldier specifically is in control of. The first of \nwhich is trigger control. This includes whether, when, and how to engage. It \nincorporates the Soldier as a function of safety, as well as the ultimate \nresponsibility of firing the weapon. \n \nMovement – the process of the Soldier moving during the engagement \nprocess. It includes the Soldier’s ability to move laterally, forward, \ndiagonally, and in a retrograde manner while maintaining stabilization, \nappropriate aim, and control of the weapon.  \n5-12. These elements define the tactical engagement that require the Soldier to make \nadjustments to determine appropriate actions, and compensate for external influences on \ntheir shot process. When all elements are applied to the fullest extent, Soldiers will be \nable to rapidly engage targets with the highest level of precision.  \n5-13. Time, target size, target distance, and the Soldier’s skills and capabilities \ndetermine the amount of effort required of each of the functional elements to minimize \ninduced errors of the shot.  \n5-14. Each weapon, tactical situation, and sight system will have preferred techniques \nfor each step in the shot process and within the functional elements to produce precision \nand accuracy in a timely manner. How fast or slow the shooter progresses through the \nprocess is based on target size, target distance, and shooter capability.  \n5-15. The most complex form of shooting is under combat conditions when the Soldier \nis moving, the enemy is moving, under limited visibility conditions. Soldiers and leaders \nmust continue to refine skills and move training from the simplest shot to the most \ncomplex. Applying the functional elements during the shot process builds a firer’s speed \nwhile maintaining consistency, accuracy, and precision during complex engagements. \n5-16. Each of the functional elements and the Soldier actions to consider during the \nshot process are described later in this manual.  \n",
    "page: 86, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 5 \n5-4 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nTARGET ACQUISITION \n5-17. Target acquisition is the ability of a Soldier to rapidly recognize threats to the \nfriendly unit or formation. It is a critical Soldier function before any shot process begins. \nIt includes the Soldier’s ability to use all available optics, sensors, and information to \ndetect potential threats as quickly as possible. \n5-18. Target acquisition requires the Soldier to apply an acute attention to detail in a \ncontinuous process based on the tactical situation. The target acquisition process \nincludes all the actions a Soldier must execute rapidly: \n \nDetect potential threats (target detection). \n \nIdentify the threat as friend, foe, or noncombatant (target identification). \n \nPrioritize the threat(s) based on the level of danger they present (target \nprioritization). \nTARGET DETECTION \n5-19. Effective target detection requires a series of skills that Soldiers must master. \nDetection is an active process during combat operations with or without a clear or known \nthreat presence. All engagements are enabled by the Soldier’s detection skills, and are \nbuilt upon three skill sets: \n \nScan and search – a rapid sequence of various techniques to identify \npotential threats. Soldier scanning skills determine potential areas where \nthreats are most likely to appear. \n \nAcquire – a refinement of the initial scan and search, based on irregularities \nin the environment. \n \nLocate – the ability to determine the general location of a threat to engage \nwith accuracy or inform the small unit leader of contact with a potential \nthreat. \nScan and Search \n5-20. Scanning and searching is the art of observing an assigned sector. The goal of the \nscan and search is a deliberate detection of potential threats based on irregularities in the \nsurrounding environment. This includes irregular shapes, colors, heat sources, \nmovement, or actions the Soldier perceives as being “out of place,” as compared to the \nsurrounding area.  \n5-21. Soldiers use five basic search and scan techniques to detect potential threats in \ncombat situations: \n Rapid scan – used to detect obvious signs of threat activity quickly. It is \nusually the first method used, whether on the offense or fighting in the \ndefense. \n Slow scan – if no threats are detected during the rapid scan, Soldiers conduct \nthe more deliberate scan using various optics, aiming devices, or sensors. The \nslow scan is best conducted in the defense or during slow movement or \ntactical halts. \n",
    "page: 87, manual name: riflecarbine\nEmployment \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n5-5 \n Horizontal scan – are used when operating in restricted or urban terrain. It \nis a horizontal sweeping scan that focuses on key areas where potential threats \nmay be over watching their movement or position. \n Vertical scan – an up and down scan in restricted or urban environments to \nidentify potential threats that may be observing the unit from an elevated \nposition. \n Detailed search – used when no threats are detected using other scanning \nmethods. The detailed search uses aiming devices, thermal weapon systems, \nmagnified optics, or other sensors to slowly and methodically review \nlocations of interest where the Soldier would be positioned if they were the \nthreat (where would I be if I were them?) \nAcquire \n5-22. Target acquisition is the discovery of any object in the operational environment \nsuch as personnel, vehicles, equipment, or objects of potential military significance. \nTarget acquisition occurs during target scan and search as a direct result of observation \nand the detection process. \n5-23. During the scan and search, Soldiers are looking for “target signatures,” which \nare signs or evidence of a threat. Tactically, Soldiers will be looking for threat personnel, \nobstacles or mines (including possible improvised explosive devices [IEDs]), vehicles, \nor anti-tank missile systems. These target signatures can be identified with sight, sound, \nor smell.  \nDetection Best Practices \n5-24. Threat detection is a critical skill that requires thoughtful application of the \nsensors, optics, and systems at the Soldier’s disposal. Finding potential threats as quickly \nand effectively as possible provides the maximum amount of time to defeat the threat. \nSoldiers should be familiar with the following best practices to increase target detection: \n \nScan with the unaided eye first, then with a magnified optic. \n \nPractice using I2 and thermal optics in tandem during limited visibility. \n \nUnderstand the difference between I2 and thermal optics; what they can \n“see” and what they can’t.

Target location is the determination of where a target is in your operational \nenvironment in relation to the shooter, small unit, or element. Locating a target or series \nof targets occurs as a result of the search and acquisition actions of each Soldier in the \nsmall unit. \n5-26. Once a target is located, the threat location can be rapidly and efficiently \ncommunicated to the rest of the unit. Methods used to announce a located target depend \non the individual’s specific position, graphic control measures for the operation, unit \nSOP, and time available. \nTARGET IDENTIFICATION \n5-27. Identifying (or discriminating) a target as friend, foe, or noncombatant (neutral) \nis the second step in the target acquisition process. The Soldier must be able to positively \nidentify the threat into one of three classifications: \n \nFriend. Any force, U.S. or allied, that is jointly engaged in combat \noperations with an enemy in a theater of operation. \n \nFoe (enemy combatant). Any individual who has engaged acts against the \nU.S. or its coalition partners in violation of the laws and customs of war \nduring an armed conflict. \n \nNoncombatants. Personnel, organizations, or agencies that are not taking a \ndirect part in hostilities. This includes individuals such as medical personnel, \nchaplains, United Nations observers, or media representatives or those out of \ncombat such as the wounded or sick. Organizations like the Red Cross or \nRed Crescent can be classified as noncombatants.  \n5-28. The identification process is complicated by the increasing likelihood of having \nto discriminate between friend/foe and combatant/noncombatant in urban settings or \nrestricted terrain. To mitigate fratricide and unnecessary collateral damage, Soldiers use \nall of the situational understanding tools available and develop tactics, techniques, and \nprocedures for performing target discrimination. \nFratricide Prevention \n5-29. Units have other means of designating friendly vehicles from the enemy. \nTypically, these marking systems are derived from the unit tactical standard operating \nprocedure (TACSOP) or other standardization publications, and applied to the \npersonnel, small units, or vehicles as required: \n \nMarkings. Unit markings are defined within the unit SOP. They distinctly \nidentify a vehicle as friendly in a standardized manner.  \n \nPanels. VS-17 panels provide a bright recognition feature that allows \nSoldiers to identify friendly vehicles through the day sight during unlimited \nvisibility. Panels do not provide a thermal signature. \n",
    "page: 89, manual name: riflecarbine\nEmployment \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n5-7 \n \nLighting. Chemical or light emitting diode lights provide a means of \nmarking vehicles at night. However, chemical lights are not visible through \na thermal sight. An IR variant is available for use with night vision devices. \nLighting systems do not provide for thermal identification during day or \nlimited visibility operations. \n \nBeacons and Strobes. Beacons and strobes are unit-procured, small-scale, \ncompact, battery-operated flashing devices that operate in the near infrared \nwavelength. They are clearly visibly through night vision optics, but cannot \nbe viewed through thermal optics.  \nNote. \nBeacons and strobes generate illumination signals that can \nonly be viewed by I2 optics. The signal cannot be viewed by thermal \noptics. Leaders and Soldiers are required to be aware of which optic \ncan effectively view these systems when developing their SOPs and \nwhen using them in training or combat. \nBeacons and strobes have the potential to be viewed by enemy \nelements with night vision capabilities. Units should tailor use of the \nbeacon based on METT-TC. \n \nSymbols. Unit symbols may be used to mark friendly vehicles. An inverted \nV, for example, painted on the flanks, rear, and fronts of a vehicle, aid in \nidentifying a target as friendly. These are typically applied in an area of \noperations and not during training. Symbol marking systems do not provide \nfor thermal identification during day or limited visibility operations. \nTARGET PRIORITIZATION \n5-30. When faced with multiple targets, the Soldier must prioritize each target and \ncarefully plan his shots to ensure successful target engagement. Mental preparedness \nand the ability to make split-second decisions are the keys to a successful engagement \nof multiple targets. The proper mindset will allow the Soldier to react instinctively and \ncontrol the pace of the battle, rather than reacting to the adversary threat. \n5-31. Targets are prioritized into three threat levels— \n \nMost dangerous. A threat that has the capability to defeat the friendly force \nand is preparing to do so. These targets must be defeated immediately. \n \nDangerous. A threat that has the capability to defeat the friendly force, but \nis not prepared to do so. These targets are defeated after all most dangerous \ntargets are eliminated. \n \nLeast dangerous. Any threat that does not have the ability to defeat the \nfriendly force, but has the ability to coordinate with other threats that are \nmore prepared. These targets are defeated after all threats of a higher threat \nlevel are defeated. \n",

When multiple targets of the same threat level are encountered, the targets are \nprioritized according to the threat they represent. The standard prioritization of targets \nestablishes the order of engagement. Firers engage similar threats by the following \nguide: \n \nNear before far. \n \nFrontal before flank. \n \nStationary before moving. \n5-33. The prioritization of targets provides a control mechanism for the shooter, and \nfacilitates maintaining overmatch over the presented threats. Firers should be prepared \ndeviate from the prioritization guide based on the situation, collective fire command, or \nchanges to the target’s activities. \n \n \n",
    "page: 91, manual name: riflecarbine\n \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n6-1 \nChapter 6 \nStability \nStability is the ability of the Soldier to create a stable firing platform \nfor the engagement. The Soldier stabilizes the weapon to provide a \nconsistent base from which to fire from and maintain through the \nshot process until the recoil impulse has ceased. This process \nincludes how the Soldier holds the weapon, uses structures or \nobjects to provide stability, and the Soldier’s posture on the ground \nduring an engagement. A stable firing platform is essential during \nthe shot process, whether the Soldier is stationary or moving. \nThis chapter provides the principles of developing a stable firing \nplatform, describes the interaction between the Soldier, weapon, the \nsurroundings, and the methods to achieve the greatest amount of \nstability in various positions. It explains how the stability functional \nelement supports the shot process and interacts and integrates the \nother three elements. Stability provides a window of opportunity to \nmaintain sight alignment and sight picture for the most accurate \nshot. \nSUPPORT \n6-1. \nStability is provided through four functions: support, muscle relaxation, natural \npoint of aim, and recoil management. These functions provide the Soldier the means to \nbest stabilize their weapon system during the engagement process. \n6-2. \nThe placement or arrangement of sandbags, equipment, or structures that directly \nprovide support to the upper receiver of the weapon to provide increased stability. This \nincludes the use of a bipod or vertical foregrip, bone and muscle support provided by \nthe shooter to stabilize the rifle. \n6-3. \nSupport can be natural or artificial or a combination of both. Natural support \ncomes from a combination of the shooter’s bones and muscles. Artificial support comes \nfrom objects outside the shooter’s body. The more support a particular position provides, \nthe more stable the weapon. \n \nLeg Position. The position of the legs varies greatly depending on the firing \nposition used. The position may require the legs to support the weight of the \nSoldier’s body, support the firing elbow, or to meet other requirements for \nthe firing position. When standing unsupported, the body is upright with the \nlegs staggered and knees slightly bent. In the prone, the firer’s legs may be \nspread apart flat on the ground or bent at the knee. In the sitting position, the \nlegs may also serve an intricate part of the firing position. \n",
    "page: 92, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 6 \n6-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \n \nStance/Center of Gravity. The physical position of a Soldier before, during, \nand after the shot that relates to the firer’s balance and posture. The \nposition/center of gravity does not apply when firing from the prone position. \nThe position/center of gravity specifically relates to the Soldier’s ability to \nmaintain the stable firing platform during firing, absorbing the recoil \nimpulses, and the ability to aggressively lean toward the target area during \nthe shot process. \n Firing Elbow. The placement of the firing elbow during the shot process. \nProper elbow placement provides consistent firing hand grip while standing, \nsitting, or kneeling, and provides support stability in the prone position. \n Nonfiring Elbow. The Soldier’s placement of the nonfiring elbow during \nthe shot process supports the rifle in the all positions. \n Firing Hand. Proper placement of the firing hand will aid in trigger control. \nPlace the pistol grip in the ‘V’ formed between the thumb and index finger. \nThe pressure applied is similar to a firm handshake grip. Different Soldiers \nhave different size hands and lengths of fingers, so there is no set position of \nthe finger on the trigger. To grip the weapon, the Soldier places the back \nstrap of the weapon’s pistol grip high in the web of his firing side hand \nbetween his thumb and index (trigger) finger. The Soldier’s trigger finger is \nindexed on the lower receiver, well outside the trigger guard and off the \nmagazine release to prevent inadvertent release of the magazine. The firing \nhand thumb (or trigger finger for left-handed firers) is indexed on top of the \nsafety selector switch. The Soldier grasps the pistol grip with his remaining \nthree fingers ensuring there is no gap between his middle finger and the \ntrigger guard. \n Nonfiring Hand. Proper placement of the non-firing hand is based on the \nfiring position and placement of the non-firing elbow to provide the stability \nof the weapon. Placement is adjusted during supported and unsupported \nfiring to maximize stability. The non-firing hand is placed as far forward as \ncomfortable without compromising the other elements of the position or \ninducing extreme shooter-gun angle. \n \nThe nonfiring hand supports the weight of the rifle by grasping the fore \narm. It should be a firm but relaxed grip. In all positions it should be as \nclose to the handguard as naturally possible to aid in recoil management. \n \nIf possible, the firer should strive to have the thumb of the nonfiring \nhand provide downward force on the handguard. The pressure will \nprovide the necessary force to assist in the management of the muzzle \nrise from recoil. \n \nIn all positions it should be as close to the end of the handguard as \nnaturally possible to aid in recoil management. \n \nDue to limited space on current MWS rails the above may not be \npossible but consideration should be given while mounting lasers to \nachieve an extended grip. \n \nButt Stock. Correct placement of the butt stock in the firing shoulder will \naid in achieving a solid stock weld. Side to side placement will vary \n",
    "page: 93, manual name: riflecarbine\nStability \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n6-3 \ndepending on equipment worn while firing. The butt stock is placed high \nenough in the shoulder to allow for an upright head position.  \n \nThe vertical placement of the butt stock will vary from firing position to \nfiring position. A general guideline to follow is: the higher the position \nfrom the ground, the higher the butt stock will be in the shoulder. \n \nThe term “butt stock” refers to both the butt stock (M16-series) and \ncollapsible butt stock (M4-series) for clarity.  \n \nStock Weld. Stock weld is the placement of the firer’s head on the stock of \nthe weapon. Correct stock weld is critical to sight alignment. The firer rests \nthe full weight of the head on the stock. The head position is as upright as \npossible to give the best vision through the aiming device. It allows for \nscanning additional targets not seen through the aiming device.  \n \nWhen establishing the stock weld, bring the rifle up to your head, not \nyour head down to the rifle. The firer’s head will remain in the same \nlocation on the stock while firing, but the location may change when \npositions are changed. The bony portion of the cheek placed on the stock \nis the basic starting point. Soldiers adapt to their facial structure to find \nthe optimal placement that allows for both sight alignment and repetitive \nplacement.  \n \nFigure 6-1 shows the differences in head placement, which effects sight \nalignment. The firer on the right is NOT resting the full weight of their \nhead on the stock. The picture on the left shows the skin of the firer’s \nhead being pushed down by the full weight of their head. This technique \ncan be quickly observed and corrected by a peer coach.  \nNote. Soldiers’ bodies vary with the amount of flesh and the bone structure \nof the face. Firers who apply downward force simply to achieve the \nappearance in the correct (left) image in figure 6-1, on page 6-4, will not have \nrelaxation and will not have a repeatable placement. The goal is to have \nalignment with consistent placement. \n",

Stock weld \nMUSCLE RELAXATION \n6-4. \nMuscle relaxation is the ability of the Soldier to maintain orientation of the \nweapon appropriately during the shot process while keeping the major muscle groups \nfrom straining to maintain the weapon system’s position. Relaxed muscles contribute to \nstability provided by support.  \n \nStrained or fatigued muscles detract from stability. \n \nAs a rule, the more support from the shooter’s bones the less he requires from \nhis muscles.  \n \nThe more skeletal support, the more stable the position, as bones do not \nfatigue or strain. \n \nAs a rule, the less muscle support required, the longer the shooter can stay in \nposition.  \nNATURAL POINT OF AIM  \n6-5. \nThe natural point of aim is the point where the barrel naturally orients when the \nshooter’s muscles are relaxed and support is achieved. The natural point of aim is built \nupon the following principles:  \n \nThe closer the natural point of aim is to the target, the less muscle support \nrequired.  \n \nThe more stable the position, the more resistant to recoil it is.  \n \nMore of the shooter’s body on the ground equals a more stable position.  \n \nMore of the shooter’s body on the ground equals less mobility for the shooter.  \n6-6. \nWhen a Soldier aims at a target, the lack of stability creates a wobble area, where \nthe sights oscillate slightly around and through the point of aim. If the wobble area is \nlarger than the target, the Soldier requires a steadier position or a refinement to their \nposition to decrease the size of his wobble area before trigger squeeze.  \n",
    "page: 95, manual name: riflecarbine\nStability \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n6-5 \nNote. The steadier the position, the smaller the wobble area. The smaller the \nwobble area, the more precise the shot. \n6-7. \nTo check a shooter’s natural point of aim, the Soldier should assume a good \nsteady position and get to the natural pause. Close their eyes, go through one cycle, and \nthen open their eyes on the natural pause. Where the sights are laying at this time, is the \nnatural point of aim for that position. If it is not on their point of aim for their target, \nthey should make small adjustments to their position to get the reticle or front sight post \nback on their point of aim. The Soldier will repeat this process until the natural point of \naim is on the point of aim on their target.  \nRECOIL MANAGEMENT \n6-8. \nRecoil management is the result of a Soldier assuming and maintaining a stable \nfiring position which mitigates the disturbance of one's sight picture during the cycle of \nfunction of the weapon.  \n6-9. \nThe Soldier’s firing position manages recoil using support of the weapon system, \nthe weight of their body, and the placement of the weapon during the shot process. \nProper recoil management allows the sights to rapidly return to the target and allows for \nfaster follow up shots.  \nSHOOTER–GUN ANGLE \n6-10. The shooter gun-angle is the relationship between the shooters upper body and \nthe direction of the weapon. This angle is typically different from firing position to firing \nposition, and directly relates to the Soldier’s ability to control recoil. Significant changes \nin the shooter-gun angle can result in eye relief and stock weld changes. \nNote. Units with a mix of left and right handed shooters can take advantage \nof each Soldiers' natural carry positions, and place left-handed shooters on \nthe right flanks, and right-handed shooters on the left flanks, as their natural \ncarry alignment places the muzzle away from the core element, and outward \ntoward potential threats, and reduces the challenges of firing when moving \nlaterally. \nFIELD OF VIEW \n6-11. The field of view is the extent that the human eye can see at any given moment. \nThe field of view is based on the Soldier’s view without using magnification, optics, or \nthermal devices. The field of view is what the Soldier sees, and includes the areas where \nthe Soldier can detect potential threats. \n",

Soldiers use the hang when they need their hands for other tasks and no threat is \npresent or likely (see figure 6-2). The weapon is slung and the safety is engaged. The \nhang carry should not be used when the weapon control status is RED. The reduced \nsecurity of the weapon may cause the mechanical safety select lever to unintentionally \nmove to SEMI or BURST/AUTO. \n \n \nFigure 6-2. Hang carry example \n \n \n",

The safe hang is used when no immediate threat is present and the hands are not \nnecessary (see figure 6-3). In the safe hang carry, the weapon is slung, the safety is \nengaged, and the Soldier has gripped the rifle’s pistol grip. The Soldier sustains Rule 3, \nkeeping the finger off the trigger until ready to engage when transitioning to the ready \nor ready up position. \n6-15. In this position, the Soldier can move in any direction while simultaneously \nmaintaining his muzzle oriented at the ground by using his firing hand. This carry \nprovides control of the weapon, flexibility in movement, and positive control of the \nweapon’s fire controls. \n \n \nFigure 6-3. Safe hang example \n \n \n",

The collapsed low ready is used when a greater degree of muzzle control and \nreadiness to respond to threats or weapon retention is necessary (such as crowded \nenvironments). In the collapsed low ready, the firing hand is secure on the weapon’s \npistol grip. The non-firing hand is placed on the hand guards or vertical foregrip (see \nfigure 6-4). \n6-17. This carry allows a Soldier to navigate crowded or restrictive environments while \nsimultaneously minimizing or eliminating his muzzle covering (flagging) by \nmaintaining positive control of the muzzle orientation. \n \n \nFigure 6-4.

The low ready provides the highest level of readiness and with the maximum \namount of observable area for target acquisition purposes \n6-19. In the low ready position, the weapon is slung, the butt stock is in the Soldier’s \nshoulder, and the muzzle is angled down at a 30- to 45-degree angle and oriented \ntowards the Soldier’s sector of fire.  \n6-20. Firing hand is positioned on the pistol grip with the index finger straight and out \nof the trigger guard. The thumb is placed on the selector lever with the lever placed on \nsafe. From this carry, the Soldier is ready to engage threats within a very short amount \nof time with minimal movement. (See figure 6-5). \n6-21. Observation is maintained to the sector of fire. The Soldier looks over the top of \nhis optics or sights to maintain situation awareness of his sector. The Soldier’s head \nremains upright. \n \n \nFigure 6-5. Low ready position \n \n \n",

The high ready is used when the Soldier’s sector of fire includes areas overhead or \nwhen an elevated muzzle orientation is appropriate for safety (see figure 6-6). The high \nready carry is used when contact is likely.  \n6-23. In the high ready, the weapon is slung, butt stock is in the armpit, the muzzle \nangled up to at least a 45-degree angle and oriented toward the Soldier’s sector of fire—\nensuring no other Soldiers are flagged.  \n6-24. The firing hand remains in the same position as the low ready. The non-firing \nside hand can be free as the weapon is supported by the firing side hand and armpit.  \n6-25. This position is not as effective as the low ready for several reasons: it impedes \nthe field of view, flags friendlies above the sector of fire, and typically takes longer to \nacquire the target. \n \n \nFigure 6-6.

    "page: 103, manual name: riflecarbine\nStability \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n6-13 \nSTABILIZED FIRING \n6-29. The Soldier must stabilize their weapon, whether firing from a stationary position \nor while on the move. To create a stabilized platform, Soldiers must understand the \nphysical relationship between the weapon system, the shooter’s body, the ground, and \nany other objects touching the weapon or shooter’s body. The more contact the shooter \nhas to the ground will determine how stable and effective the position is. The situation \nand tactics will determine the actual position used. \n6-30. When a shooter assumes a stable firing position, movement from muscle tension, \nbreathing, and other natural activities within the body will be transferred to the weapon \nand must be compensated for by the shooter.  \n6-31. Failing to create an effective platform to fire from is termed a stabilization \nfailure. A stabilization failure occurs when a Soldier fails to: \n \nControl the movement of the barrel during the arc of movement \n \nAdequately support the weapon system \n \nAchieve their natural point of aim.  \n6-32. These failures compound the firing occasion’s errors, which directly correlate to \nthe accuracy of the shot taken. To maximize the Soldier’s stability during the shot \nprocess, they correctly assume various firing positions when stationary, or offset the \ninduced errors with other firing skills during tactical movement. \n6-33. As a rule, positions that are lower to the ground provide a higher level of stability. \nWhen the center of gravity elevates the level of stability decreases as shown in \nfigure°6-8.  \n \n \n",

The nature of combat will not always allow time for a Soldier to get into a \nparticular position. Soldiers need to practice firing in a variety of positions, including \nappropriate variations. There are 12 firing positions with variations that are common to \nall Soldiers.  The positions are listed highest to lowest. The primary position is listed in \nbold, with the position variations in italics: \n \nStanding –  \n \nStanding, unsupported. \n \nStanding, supported. \n \nSquatting – This position allows for rapid engagement of targets when an \nobstruction blocks the firer from using standard positions. It provides the \nfirer a fairly well supported position by simply squatting down to engage, \nthen returning to a standing position once the engagement is complete. The \nsquatting position is generally unsupported. \n \nKneeling – The kneeling position is very common and useful in most combat \nsituations. The kneeling position can be supported or unsupported. \n \nKneeling, unsupported. \n \nKneeling, supported. \n \nSitting – There are three types of sitting positions: crossed-ankle, crossed-\nleg, and open-leg. All positions are easy to assume, present a medium \nsilhouette, provide some body contact with the ground, and form a stable \nfiring position. These positions allow easy access to the sights for zeroing.  \n \nSitting, crossed ankle. \n \nSitting, crossed leg. \n \nSitting, open leg. \n \nProne – The prone position is the most stable firing position due to the \namount of the Soldier’s body is in contact with the ground. The majority of \nthe firer’s frame is behind the rifle to assist with recoil management.  \n \nProne, unsupported. \n \nProne, supported. \n \nProne, roll-over. \n \nProne, reverse roll-over. \n6-35. Soldiers must practice the positions dry frequently to establish their natural point \nof aim for each position, and develop an understanding of the restrictive nature of their \nequipment during execution. With each dry repetition, the Soldier’s ability to change \npositions rapidly and correctly are developed, translating into efficient movement and \nconsistent stable firing positions. \n6-36.

Figure 6-12 \nshows the optimum unsupported kneeling position. The firer should be leaning slightly \nforward into the position to allow for recoil management and quicker follow-up shots. \nThe primary goal of this firing position is to establish the smallest wobble area possible. \nKey focus areas for kneeling, unsupported are: \n \nNonfiring elbow. Place the non-firing elbow directly underneath the rifle as \nmuch as possible. The elbow should be placed either in front of or behind the \nkneecap. Placing the elbow directly on the kneecap will cause it to roll and \nincreases the wobble area. \n \nLeg position. The non-firing leg should be bent approximately 90 degrees at \nthe knee and be directly under the rifle. The firing-side leg should be \nperpendicular to the nonfiring leg. The firer may rest their body weight on \nthe heel. Some firers lack the flexibility to do this and may have a gap \nbetween their buttocks and the heel. \n \nAggressive (stretch) kneeling. All weight on non-firing foot, thigh to calf, \nupper body leaning forward, nonfiring triceps on non-firing knee, firing leg \nstretched behind for support. Highly effective for rapid fire and movement. \n \n \nFigure 6-12. Kneeling, unsupported example \n \n \n",

The kneeling supported position uses artificial support to steady the position (see \nfigure 6-13). Contact by the nonfiring hand and elbow with the artificial support is the \nprimary difference between the kneeling supported and unsupported positions since it \nassists in the stability of the weapon. Body contact is good, but the barrel of the rifle \nmust not touch the artificial support. Forward pressure is applied to aid in recoil \nmanagement. The key focus areas for the kneeling supported position are applied in the \nfollowing ways: \n \nNonfiring hand. The nonfiring hand will hold the hand guards firmly and \nwill also be pushed against the artificial support. Hand positioning will vary \ndepending on the type of support used.  \n \nNonfiring elbow. The nonfiring elbow and forearm may be used to assist \nwith the weapon’s stability by pushing against the artificial support. The \ncontact of the nonfiring elbow and forearm with the structure will vary \ndepending on the support used and the angle to the target.  \n \n \nFigure 6-13. Kneeling, supported example \n \n \n",

    "page: 119, manual name: riflecarbine\n \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n7-1 \nChapter 7 \nAim \nThe functional element aim of the shot process is the continuous \nprocess of orienting the weapon correctly, aligning the sights, \naligning on the target, and the application of the appropriate lead \nand elevation during a target engagement. Aiming is a continuous \nprocess conducted through pre-shot, shot, and post-shot, to \neffectively apply lethal fires in a responsible manner with accuracy \nand precision. \nAiming is the application of perfectly aligned sights on a specific \npart of a target. Sight alignment is the first and most important part \nof this process. \nCOMMON ENGAGEMENTS \n7-1. \nThe aiming process for engaging stationary targets consist of the following \nSoldier actions, regardless of the optic, sight, or magnification used by the aiming \ndevice: \n \nWeapon orientation – the direction of the weapon as it is held in a stabilized \nmanner. \n \nSight alignment – the physical alignment of the aiming device: \n \nIron sight/back-up iron sight and the front sight post. \n \nOptic reticle. \n \nBallistic reticle (day or thermal). \n \nSight picture – the target as viewed through the line of sight. \n \nPoint of aim (POA) – the specific location where the line of sight intersects \nthe target. \n \nDesired point of impact (POI)–the desired location of the strike of the \nround to achieve the desired outcome (incapacitation or lethal strike). \n7-2. \nThe aim of the weapon is typically applied to the largest, most lethal area of any \ntarget presented. Sights can be placed on target by using battlesight zero (BZ), center of \nvisible mass (CoVM). The center of visible mass is the initial point of aim on a target of \nwhat can be seen by the Soldier. It does not include what the target size is expected or \nanticipated to be. For example, a target located behind a car exposes its head. The center \nof visible mass is in the center of the head, not the estimated location of the center of the \noverall target behind the car. \n \n \n",
    "page: 120, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 7 \n7-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nWEAPON ORIENTATION \n7-3. \nThe Soldier orients the weapon in the direction of the detected threat. Weapon \norientation includes both the horizontal plane (azimuth) and the vertical plane \n(elevation). Weapon orientation is complete once the sight and threat are in the Soldier’s \nfield of view.  \n \nHorizontal weapons orientation covers the frontal arc of the Soldier, \nspanning the area from the left shoulder, across the Soldier’s front, to the \narea across the right shoulder (see figure 7-1). \n \nFigure 7-1. Horizontal weapon orientation example \n \n \n",
    "page: 121, manual name: riflecarbine\nAim \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n7-3 \n \nVertical weapons orientation includes all the aspects of orienting the \nweapon at a potential or confirmed threat in elevation. This is most \ncommonly applied in restricted, mountainous, or urban terrain where threats \npresent themselves in elevated or depressed firing positions (see figure 7-2). \n \nFigure 7-2. Vertical weapons orientation example \nSIGHT ALIGNMENT \n7-4. \nSight alignment is the relationship between the aiming device and the firer’s eye. \nThe process used by a Soldier depends on the aiming device employed with the weapon.  \n \nIron sight – the relationship between the front sight post, rear sight aperture, \nand the firer’s eye. The firer aligns the tip of the front sight post in the center \nof the rear aperture and his/or her eye. The firer will maintain focus on the \nfront sight post, simultaneously centering it in the rear aperture. \n \nOptics – the relationship between the reticle and the firer’s eye and includes \nthe appropriate eye relief, or distance of the Soldier’s eye from the optic \nitself. Ensure the red dot is visible in the CCO, or a full centered field of view \nis achieved with no shadow on magnified optics \n \nThermal – the relationship between the firer’s eye, the eyepiece, and the \nreticle. \n \nPointers / Illuminators / Lasers – the relationship between the firer’s eye, \nthe night vision device placement and focus, and the laser aiming point on \nthe target. \n",

Small changes matter - 1/1000 of an inch deviation at the weapon can \nresult in up to an 18 inch deviation at 300 meters.  \n7-5. \nThe human eye can only focus clearly on one object at a time. To achieve proper \nand effective aim, the focus of the firer’s eye needs to be on the front sight post or reticle \n(see figure 7-3). This provides the most accurate sight alignment for the shot process. \n \nFigure 7-3. Front sight post/reticle aim focus \n7-6. \nFirers achieve consistent sight alignment by resting the full weight of their head \non the stock in a manner that allows their dominant eye to look through the center of the \naiming or sighting device. If the firer’s head placement is subjected to change during the \nfiring process or between shots, the Soldier will experience difficultly achieving \naccurate shot groups. \n",
    "page: 123, manual name: riflecarbine\nAim \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n7-5 \nSIGHT PICTURE \n7-7. \nThe sight picture is the placement of the aligned sights on the target itself. The \nSoldier must maintain sight alignment throughout the positioning of the sights. This is \nnot the same as sight alignment. \n7-8. There are two sight pictures used during the shot process; pre-shot and post-shot. \nSoldiers must remember the sight pictures of the shot to complete the overall shot \nprocess. \n \nPre-shot sight picture – encompasses the original point of aim, sight picture, \nand any holds for target or environmental conditions.  \n \nPost-shot sight picture – is what the Soldier must use as the point of reference \nfor any sight adjustments for any subsequent shot. \nPOINT OF AIM \n7-9. \nThe point on the target that is the continuation of the line created by sight \nalignment. The point of aim is a point of reference used to calculate any hold the Soldier \ndeems necessary to achieve the desired results of the round’s impact. \n7-10. For engagements against stationary targets, under 300 meters, with negligible \nwind, and a weapon that has a 200 meter or 300 meter confirmed zero, the point of aim \nshould be the center of visible mass of the target. The point of aim does not include \nANY hold-off or lead changes necessary.  \nDESIRED POINT OF IMPACT \n7-11. The desired point of impact is the location where the Soldier wants the projectile \nto strike the target. Typically, this is the center of visible mass. At any range different \nfrom the weapon’s zero distance, the Soldier’s desired point of impact and their point of \naim will not align. This requires the Soldier to determine the necessary hold-off to \nachieve the desired point of impact. \nCOMMON AIMING ERRORS \n7-12. Orienting and aiming a weapon correctly is a practiced skill. Through drills and \nrepetitions, Soldiers build the ability to repeat proper weapons orientation, sight \nalignment, and sight picture as a function of muscle memory. \n7-13. The most common aiming errors include: \n \nNon-dominant eye use – The Soldier gets the greatest amount of visual input \nfrom their dominant eye. Eye dominance varies Soldier to Soldier. Some \nSoldier’s dominant eye will be the opposite of the dominant hand. For \nexample, a Soldier who writes with his right hand and learns to shoot rifles \nright handed might learn that his dominant eye is the left eye. This is called \ncross-dominant. Soldiers with strong cross-dominant eyes should consider \nfiring using their dominant eye side while firing from their non-dominant \nhand side. Soldiers can be trained to fire from either side of the weapon, but \nmay not be able to shoot effectively using their nondominant eye. \n",
    "page: 124, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 7 \n7-6 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \n \nIncorrect zero – regardless of how well a Soldier aims, if the zero is \nincorrect, the round will not travel to the desired point of impact without \nadjustment with subsequent rounds (see appendix C of this publication). \n \nLight conditions – limited visibility conditions contribute to errors aligning \nthe sight, selecting the correct point of aim, or determining the appropriate \nhold. Soldiers may offset the effects of low light engagements with image \nintensifier (I2) optics, use of thermal optics, or the use of laser pointing \ndevices with I2 optics. \n \nBattlefield obscurants – smoke, debris, and haze are common conditions on \nthe battlefield that will disrupt the Soldier’s ability to correctly align their \nsights, select the proper point of aim, or determine the correct hold for a \nspecific target. \n \nIncorrect sight alignment – Soldiers may experience this error when failing \nto focus on the front sight post or reticle. \n \nIncorrect sight picture – occurs typically when the threat is in a concealed \nlocation, is moving, or sufficient winds between the shooter and target exist \nthat are not accounted for during the hold determination process. This failure \ndirectly impacts the Soldier’s ability to create and sustain the proper sight \npicture during the shot process. \n \nImproper range determination – will result in an improper hold at ranges \ngreater than the zeroed range for the weapon.  \nCOMPLEX ENGAGEMENTS \n7-14. A complex engagement includes any shot that cannot use the CoVM as the point \nof aim to ensure a target hit. Complex engagements require a Soldier to apply various \npoints of aim to successfully defeat the threat.  \n7-15. These engagements have an increased level of difficulty due to environmental, \ntarget, or shooter conditions that create a need for the firer to rapidly determine a ballistic \nsolution and apply that solution to the point of aim. Increased engagement difficulty is \ntypically characterized by one or more of the following conditions: \n \nTarget conditions: \n \nRange to target. \n \nMoving targets. \n \nOblique targets. \n \nEvasive targets. \n \nLimited exposure targets. \n \nEnvironmental conditions: \n \nWind. \n \nAngled firing. \n \nLimited visibility. \n \nShooter conditions: \n \nMoving firing position.\n",

Each of these firing conditions may require the Soldier to determine an \nappropriate aim point that is not the CoVM. This Soldier calculated aim point is called \nthe hold. During any complex engagement, the Soldier serves as the ballistic computer \nduring the shot process. The hold represents a refinement or alteration of the center of \nvisible mass point of aim at the target to counteract certain conditions during a complex \nengagement for— \n \nRange to target. \n \nLead for targets based on their direction and speed of movement.  \n \nCounter-rotation lead required when the Soldier is moving in the opposite \ndirection of the moving target. \n \nWind speed, direction, and duration between the shooter and the target at \nranges greater than 300 meters. \n \nGreatest lethal zone presented by the target to provide the most probable \npoint of impact to achieve immediate incapacitation. \n7-17. The Soldier will apply the appropriate aim (hold) based on the firing instances \npresented. Hold determinations will be discussed in two formats; immediate and \ndeliberate. \n7-18. All Soldiers must be familiar with the immediate hold determination methods. \nThey should be naturally applied when the engagement conditions require. These \ndeterminations are provided in “target form” measurements, based on a standard E-type \nsilhouette dimension, approximately 20 inches wide by 40 inches tall. \nIMMEDIATE HOLD DETERMINATION \n7-19. Immediate holds are based on the values of a “target form,” where the increments \nshown are sufficient for rapid target hits without ballistic computations. The immediate \nhold determinations are not as accurate as the deliberate method, and are used for \ncomplex target engagements at less than 300 meters. \n7-20.

    "page: 128, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 7 \n7-10 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nTARGET CONDITIONS \n7-24. Soldiers must consider several aspects of the target to apply the proper point of \naim on the target. The target’s posture, or how it is presenting itself to the shooter, \nconsists of— \n \nRange to target. \n \nNature of the target. \n \nNature of the terrain (surrounding the target). \nRANGE TO TARGET \n7-25. Rapidly determining an accurate range to target is critical to the success of the \nSoldier at mid and extended ranges. There are several range determination methods \nshooters should be confident in applying to determine the proper hold-off for pending \nengagements. There are two types of range determination methods, immediate and \ndeliberate.  \nImmediate Range Determination \n7-26. Immediate methods of range determination afford the shooter the most reliable \nmeans of determining the most accurate range to a given target. The immediate methods \ninclude— \n \nClose quarters engagements. \n \nLaser range finder. \n \nFront sight post method. \n \nRecognition method. \n \n100-meter unit-of-measure method. \nClose Quarters Engagements \n7-27. Short-range engagements are probable in close terrain (such as urban or jungle) \nwith engagement ranges typically less than 50 meters. Soldiers must be confident in \ntheir equipment, zero, and capabilities to defeat the threats encountered.  \n7-28. Employment skills include swift presentation and application of the shot process \n(such as quick acquisition of sight picture) to maintain overmatch. At close ranges, \nperfect sight alignment is not as critical to the accurate engagement of targets. The \nweapon is presented rapidly and the shot is fired with the front sight post placed roughly \ncenter mass on the desired target area. The front sight post must be in the rear sight \naperture. \nNote. If using iron sights when this type of engagement is anticipated, the \nlarge rear sight aperture (0-2) should be used to provide a wider field of view \nand detection of targets. \n",
    "page: 129, manual name: riflecarbine\nAim \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n7-11 \nLaser Range Finder \n7-29. Equipment like the AN/PSQ-23, STORM have an on-board laser range finder \nthat is accurate to within +/- 5 meters. Soldiers with the STORM attached can rapidly \ndetermine the most accurate range to target and apply the necessary hold-offs to ensure \nthe highest probability of incapacitation, particularly at extended ranges. \nFront Sight Post Method \n7-30. The area of the target that is covered by the front sight post of the rifle can be \nused to estimate range to the target. By comparing the appearance of the rifle front sight \npost on a target at known distances, your shooters can establish a mental reference point \nfor determining range at unknown distances. Because the apparent size of the target \nchanges as the distance to the target changes, the amount of the target that is covered by \nthe front sight post will vary depending upon its range. In addition, your shooter’s eye \nrelief and perception of the front sight post will also affect the amount of the target that \nis visible (see figure 7-6). \n \nLess Than 300 Meters. If the target is wider than the front sight post, you can \nassume that the target is less than 300 meters and can be engaged point of \naim/point of impact using your battle sight zero (BZO). \n \nGreater Than 300 Meters. The service rifle front sight post covers the width \nof a man's chest or body at approximately 300 meters. If the target is less \nthan the width of the front sight post, you should assume the target is in \nexcess of 300 meters. Therefore, your BZO cannot be used effectively. \n \nFigure 7-6. Front sight post method example \nRecognition Method \n7-31. When observing a target, the amount of detail seen at various ranges gives the \nshooter a solid indication of the range to target. Shooters should study and remember \nthe appearance of a person when they are standing at 100 meters increments. During \n",
    "page: 130, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 7 \n7-12 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \ntraining, Soldiers should note the details of size and the characteristics of uniform and \nequipment for targets at those increments.  \n7-32. Once Soldiers are familiar and memorize the characteristics of standing threats at \n100 meter increments out to 500 meters, they should study the targets in a kneeling and \nthen in the prone position. By comparing the appearance of these positions at known \nranges from 100 meters to 500 meters, shooters can establish a series of mental images \nthat will help determine range on unfamiliar terrain. They should also study the \nappearance of other familiar objects such as weapons and vehicles.  \n \n100 meters – the target can be clearly observed in detail, and facial features \ncan be distinguished. \n \n200 meters – the target can be clearly observed, although there is a loss of \nfacial detail. The color of the skin and equipment is still identifiable. \n \n300 meters – the target has a clear body outline, face color usually remains \naccurate, but remaining details are blurred. \n \n400 meters – the body outline is clear, but remaining detail is blurred. \n \n500 meters – the body shape begins to taper at the ends. The head becomes \nindistinct from the shoulders. \n100-meter Unit-of-Measure Method \n7-33. To determine the total distance to the target using the 100 meter unit of measure \nmethod, shooters must visualize a distance of 100 meters (generally visualizing the \nlength of a football field) on the ground. Soldiers then estimate how many of these units \ncan fit between the shooter and the target. \n7-34. The greatest limitation of the unit of measure method is that its accuracy is \ndirectly related to how much of the terrain is visible. This is particularly true at greater \nranges. If a target appears at a range of 500 meters or more and only a portion of the \nground between your shooter and the target can be seen, it becomes difficult to use the \nunit of measure method of range estimation with accuracy. \n7-35. Proficiency in the unit of measure method requires constant practice. Throughout \ntraining, comparisons should be continually made between the range estimated by your \nshooter and the actual range as determined by pacing or other, more accurate \nmeasurement. \nImmediate hold for Range to Target \n7-36. Immediate range determination holds are based on the zero applied to the weapon. \nThe 300 meter zero is the Army standard and works in all tactical situations, including \nclose quarters combat. Figure 7-7, on page 7-13, shows the appropriate immediate holds \nfor range to target based on the weapon’s respective zero: \n \n \n \n",

Targets on any battlefield will not remain stationary for long periods of time, \nparticularly once a firefight begins. Soldiers must have the ability to deliver lethal fires \nat a variety of moving target types and be comfortable and confident in the engagement \ntechniques. There are two methods for defeating moving targets; tracking and trapping. \nImmediate hold for moving targets. \n7-38. The immediate hold for moving targets includes an estimation of the speed of the \nmoving target and an estimation of the range to that target. The immediate holds for all \nmoving targets are shown below. (See figure 7-8.) \n \nFigure 7-8. Immediate holds for moving targets example \n \n \n",

Threats that are moving diagonally toward or away from the shooter are called \noblique targets. They offer a unique problem set to shooters where the target may be \nmoving at a steady pace and direction; however, their oblique direction of travel makes \nthem appear to move slower.  \n7-40. Soldiers should adjust their hold based on the angle of the target’s movement from \nthe gun-target line. The following guide will help Soldiers determine the appropriate \nchange to the moving target hold to apply to engage the moving oblique threats (see \nfigure 7-9). \n \nFigure 7-9.

    "page: 134, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 7 \n7-16 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS \n7-41. The environment can complicate the shooter’s actions during the shot process \nwith excessive wind or requiring angled firing limited visibility conditions. Soldiers \nmust understand the methods to offset or compensate for these firing occasions, and be \nprepared to apply these skills to the shot process. This includes when multiple complex \nconditions compound the ballistic solution during the firing occasion.  \nWIND \n7-42. Wind is the most common variable and has the greatest effect on ballistic \ntrajectories, where it physically pushes the projectile during flight off the desired \ntrajectory (see appendix B of this publication). The effects of wind can be compensated \nfor by the shooter provided they understand how wind effects the projectile and the \nterminal point of impact. The elements of wind effects are— \n \nThe time the projectile is exposed to the wind (range). \n \nThe direction from which the wind is blowing. \n \nThe velocity of the wind on the projectile during flight. \nWind Direction and Value \n7-43. Winds from the left blow the projectile to the right, and winds from the right blow \nthe projectile to the left. The amount of the effect depends on the time of (projectile’s \nexposure) the wind speed and direction. To compensate for the wind, the firer must first \ndetermine the wind’s direction and value.  \n7-44. The clock system can be used to determine the direction and value of the wind \n(See figure 7-10 on page 7-17). Picture a clock with the firer oriented downrange \ntowards 12 o’clock.  \n7-45. Once the direction is determined, the value of the wind is next. The value of the \nwind is how much effect the wind will have on the projectile. Winds from certain \ndirections have less effect on projectiles. The chart below shows that winds from 2 to \n4°o’clock and 8 to 10 o’clock are considered full-value winds and will have the most \neffect on the projectile. Winds from 1, 5, 7, and 11 o’clock are considered half-value \nwinds and will have roughly half the effect of a full-value wind. Winds from 6 and \n12°o’clock are considered no-value winds and little or no effect on the projectile.  \nEXAMPLE \nA 10-mph (miles per hour) wind blowing from the 1 o’clock direction would \nbe a half-value wind and has the same effect as a 5 mph, full-value wind \non the projectile. \n \n \n \n",

The wind will push the projectile in the direction the wind is blowing (see \nfigure 7-11). The amount of effects on the projectile will depend on the time of exposure, \ndirection of the wind, and speed of the wind. To compensate for wind the Soldier uses a \nhold in the direction of the wind (into the wind). \n \n",

Wind speeds can vary from the firing line to the target. Wind speed can be \ndetermined by taking an average of the winds blowing on the range. The firer’s focus \nshould be on the winds between the midrange point and the target. The wind at the one \nhalf to two thirds mark will have the most effect on the projectile since that is the point \nwhere most projectiles have lost a large portion of their velocity and are beginning to \ndestabilize. \n7-48. The Soldier can observe the movement of items in the environment downrange \nto determine the speed. Each environment will have different vegetation that reacts \ndifferently.  \n7-49. Downrange wind indicators include the following: \n \n0 to 3 mph = Hardly felt, but smoke drifts. \n \n3 to 5 mph = Felt lightly on the face. \n \n5 to 8 mph = Keeps leaves in constant movement.\n",
    "page: 137, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 7 \n10 January 2017  \nTC 3-22.9, C1 \n7-19 \n \n8 to 12 mph = Raises dust and loose paper. \n \n12 to 15 mph = Causes small trees to sway. \n7-50. The wind blowing at the Soldiers location may not be the same as the wind \nblowing on the way to the target.  \nWind Estimation \n7-51. Soldiers must be comfortable and confident in their ability to judge the effects of \nthe wind to consistently make accurate and precise shots. Soldiers will use wind \nindicators between the Soldier and the target that provide windage information to \ndevelop the proper compensation or hold-off.  \n7-52. To estimate the effects of the wind on the shot, Soldiers need to determine three \nwindage factors: \n \nVelocity (speed). \n \nDirection. \n \nValue.  \nImmediate Wind Hold \n7-53. Using a hold involves changing the point of aim to compensate for the wind drift. \nFor example, if wind causes the bullet to drift 1/2 form to the left, the aiming point must \nbe moved 1/2 form to the right. (See figure 7-12, page 7-20.) \n \nFigure 7-12. Wind hold example\n",
    "page: 138, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 7 \n10 January 2017 \nTC 3-22.9, C1 \n7-20\n7-54. Firers must adjust their points of aim into the wind to compensate for its effects.\nIf they miss a distant target and wind is blowing from the right, they should aim to the\nright for the next shot. A guide for the initial adjustment is to split the front sight post\non the edge of the target facing the wind.\n7-55. Newly assigned Soldiers should aim at the target's center of visible mass for the\nfirst shot, and then adjust for wind when they are confident that wind caused the miss.\nExperienced firers should apply the appropriate hold for the first shot, but should follow\nthe basic rule—when in doubt, aim at the center of mass.\nLIMITED VISIBILITY \n7-56. Soldiers must be lethal at night and in limited visibility conditions, as well as\nduring the day. That lethality depends largely on whether Soldier can fire effectively\nwith today’s technology: night vision devices (NVDs), IR aiming devices, and TWSs.\n7-57. Limited visibility conditions may limit the viewable size of a threat, or cause\ntargets to be lost after acquisition. In these situations, Soldiers may choose to apply a\nhold for where a target is expected to be rather than wait for the target to present itself\nfor a more refined reticle lay or sight picture.\n7-58. Soldiers may switch between optics, thermals, and pointers to refine their point\nof aim. To rapidly switch between aiming devices during operations in limited visibility,\nthe Soldier must ensure accurate alignment, boresighting, and zeroing of all associated\nequipment. Confidence in the equipment is achieved through drills related to changing\nthe aiming device during engagements, executing repetitions with multiple pieces of\nequipment, and practicing nonstandard engagement techniques using multiple aiming\ndevices in tandem (IR pointer with NVDs, for example).\n",
    "page: 139, manual name: riflecarbine\n \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n8-1 \nChapter 8 \nControl \nThe control element of employment considers all the conscious \nactions of the Soldier before, during, and after the shot process that \nthe Soldier’s specifically in control of. It incorporates the Soldier as \na function of safety, as well as the ultimate responsibility of firing \nthe weapon. \nProper trigger control, without disturbing the sights, is the most \nimportant aspect of control and the most difficult to master. \nCombat is the ultimate test of a Soldier's ability to apply the \nfunctional elements of the shot process and firing skills. Soldiers \nmust apply the employment skills mastered during training to all \ncombat situations (for example, attack, assault, ambush, or urban \noperations). Although these tactical situations present problems, the \napplication of the functional elements of the shot process require \ntwo additions: changes to the rate of fire and alterations in \nweapon/target alignment. This chapter discusses the engagement \ntechniques Soldiers must adapt to the continuously changing \ncombat engagements. \n8-1. \nWhen firing individual weapons, the Soldier is the weapon’s fire control system, \nballistic computer, stabilization system, and means of mobility. Control refers to the \nSoldier’s ability to regulate these functions and maintain the discipline to execute the \nshot process at the appropriate time. \n8-2. \nRegardless of how well trained or physically strong a Soldier is, a wobble area \n(or arc of movement) is present, even when sufficient physical support of the weapon is \nprovided. The arc of movement (AM) may be observed as the sights moving in a W \nshape, vertical (up and down) pulses, circular, or horizontal arcs depending on the \nindividual Soldier, regardless of their proficiency in applying the functional elements. \nThe wobble area or arc of movement is the extent of lateral horizontal and front-to-back \nvariance in the movement that occurs in the sight picture (see figure 8-1). \n \n \n \n",
    "page: 140, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 8 \n8-2 \nTC 3-22.9, C1 \n10 January 2017 \n \n \nFigure 8-1. Arc of movement example \n8-3. \nThe control element consists of several supporting Soldier functions, and include \nall the actions to minimize the Soldier’s induced arc of movement. Executed correctly, \nit provides for the best engagement window of opportunity to the firer. The Soldier \nphysically maintains positive control of the shot process by managing— \n \nTrigger control.  \n \nBreathing control.  \n \nWorkspace.  \n \nCalling the shot (firing or shot execution). \n \nFollow-through.  \nTRIGGER CONTROL \n8-4. \nTrigger control is the act of firing the weapon while maintaining proper aim and \nadequate stabilization until the bullet leaves the muzzle. Trigger control and the \nshooter’s position work together to allow the sights to stay on the target long enough for \nthe shooter to fire the weapon and bullet to exit the barrel.  \n8-5. \nStability and trigger control complement each other and are integrated during the \nshot process. A stable position assists in aiming and reduces unwanted movements \nduring trigger squeeze without inducing unnecessary movement or disturbing the sight \npicture. A smooth, consistent trigger squeeze, regardless of speed, allows the shot to fire \nat the Soldier’s moment of choosing. When both a solid position and a good trigger \nsqueeze are achieved, any induced shooting errors can be attributed to the aiming \nprocess for refinement.  \n8-6. \nSmooth trigger control is facilitated by placing the finger where it naturally lays \non the trigger. Natural placement of the finger on the trigger will allow for the best \nmechanical advantage when applying rearward pressure to the trigger. \n",
    "page: 141, manual name: riflecarbine\nControl \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n8-3 \n \nTrigger finger placement – the trigger finger will lay naturally across the \ntrigger after achieving proper grip (see figure 8-2). There is no specified point \non the trigger finger that must be used. It will not be the same for all Soldiers \ndue to different size hands. This allows the Soldier to engage the trigger in \nthe most effective manner \n \nTrigger squeeze – The Soldier pulls the trigger in a smooth consistent \nmanner adding pressure until the weapon fires. Regardless of the speed at \nwhich the Soldier is firing the trigger control will always be smooth. \n \nTrigger reset – It is important the Soldier retains focus on the sights while \nresetting the trigger. \n \nFigure 8-2. Natural trigger finger placement \n",
    "page: 142, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 8 \n8-4 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nBREATHING CONTROL \n8-7. \nDuring the shot process, the shooter controls their breathing to reduce the amount \nof movement of the weapon. During training, the Soldier will learn a method of \nbreathing control that best suits their shooting style and preference. Breathing control is \nthe relationship of the respiratory process (free or under stress) and the decision to \nexecute the shot with trigger squeeze.  \n8-8. \nBreathing induces unavoidable body movement that contribute to wobble or the \narc of movement (AM) during the shot process. Soldiers cannot completely eliminate \nall motion during the shot process, but they can significantly reduce its effects through \npractice and technique. Firing on the natural pause is a common technique used during \ngrouping and zeroing.  \n8-9. \nVertical dispersion during grouping is most likely not caused by breathing but by \nfailure to maintain proper aiming and trigger control. Refer to appendix E of this \npublication for proper target analysis techniques. \nWORKSPACE MANAGEMENT \n8-10. The workspace is a spherical area, 12 to 18 inches in diameter centered on the \nSoldier’s chin and approximately 12 inches in front of their chin. The workspace is \nwhere the majority of weapons manipulations take place. (See figure 8-3 on page 8-5.) \n8-11. Conducting manipulations in the workspace allows the Soldier to keep his eyes \noriented towards a threat or his individual sector of fire while conducting critical \nweapons tasks that require hand and eye coordination. Use of the workspace creates \nefficiency of motion by minimizing the distance the weapon has to move between the \nfiring position to the workspace and return to the firing position.  \n8-12. Location of the workspace will change slightly in different firing positions. There \nare various techniques to use the workspace. Some examples are leaving the butt stock \nin the shoulder, tucking the butt stock under the armpit for added control of the weapon, \nor placing the butt stock in the crook of the elbow. \n8-13. Workspace management includes the Soldier’s ability to perform the following \nfunctions: \n \nSelector lever – to change the weapon’s status from safe to semiautomatic, \nto burst/automatic from any position. \nNote. Some models will have ambidextrous selectors.  \n Charging handle – to smoothly use the charging handle during operation. \nThis includes any corrective actions to overcome malfunctions, loading, \nunloading, or clearing procedures. \n Bolt catch – to operate the bolt catch mechanism on the weapon during \noperations. \n Ejection port – closing the ejection port cover to protect the bolt carrier \nassembly, ammunition, and chamber from external debris upon completion \n",

This includes observation of the ejection port area during \nmalfunctions and clearing procedures. \n Magazine catch – the smooth functioning of the magazine catch during \nreloading procedures, clearing procedures, or malfunction corrective actions. \n Chamber check – the sequence used to verify the status of the weapon’s \nchamber. \n Forward assist – the routine use of the forward assist assembly of the \nweapon during loading procedures or when correcting malfunctions. \n \nFigure 8-3. Workspace example \nCALLING THE SHOT \n8-14. Knowing precisely where the sights are when the weapon discharges is critical \nfor shot analysis. Errors such as flinching or jerking of the trigger can be seen in the \nsights before discharge. \n8-15. Calling a shot refers to a firer stating exactly where he thinks a single shot strikes \nby recalling the sights relationship to the target when the weapon fired. This is normally \nexpressed in clock direction and inches from the desired point of aim.  \n8-16. The shooter is responsible for the point of impact of every round fired from their \nweapon. This requires the Soldier to ensure the target area is clear of friendly and neutral \nactors, in front of and behind the target. Soldiers must also be aware of the environment \nthe target is positioned in, particularly in urban settings—friendly or neutral actors may \nbe present in other areas of a structure that the projectile can pass through. \n \n \n",
    "page: 144, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 8 \n8-6 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nRATE OF FIRE \n8-17. The shooter must determine how to engage the threat with the weapon, on the \ncurrent shot as well as subsequent shots. Following the direction of the team leader, the \nSoldier controls the rate of fire to deliver consistent, lethal, and precise fires against the \nthreat. \nSLOW SEMIAUTOMATIC FIRE \n8-18. Slow semiautomatic fire is moderately paced at the discretion of the Soldier, \ntypically used in a training environment or a secure defensive position at approximately \n12 to 15 rounds per minute. All Soldiers learn the techniques of slow semiautomatic fire \nduring their introduction to the service rifle during initial entry training. This type of \nfiring provides the Soldier the most time to focus on the functional elements in the shot \nprocess and reinforces all previous training.  \nRAPID SEMIAUTOMATIC FIRE \n8-19. Rapid semiautomatic fire is approximately 45 rounds per minute and is typically \nused for multiple targets or combat scenarios where the Soldier does not have overmatch \nof the threat. Soldiers should be well-trained in all aspects of slow semiautomatic firing \nbefore attempting any rapid semiautomatic fire training.  \n8-20. Those who display a lack of knowledge of employment skills should not advance \nto rapid semiautomatic fire training until these skills are learned and mastered.  \nAUTOMATIC OR BURST FIRE \n8-21. Automatic or burst fire is when the Soldier is required to provide suppressive fires \nwith accuracy, and the need for precise fires, although desired, is not as important. \nAutomatic or burst fires drastically decrease the probability of hit due to the rapid \nsuccession of recoil impulses and the inability of the Soldier to maintain proper sight \nalignment and sight picture on the target. \n8-22. Soldiers should be well-trained in all aspects of slow semiautomatic firing before \nattempting any automatic training.  \n \n \n",
    "page: 145, manual name: riflecarbine\nControl \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n8-7 \nFOLLOW-THROUGH \n8-23. Follow-through is the continued mental and physical application of the functional \nelements of the shot process after the shot has been fired. The firer’s head stays in contact \nwith the stock, the firing eye remains open, the trigger finger holds the trigger back \nthrough recoil and then lets off enough to reset the trigger, and the body position and \nbreathing remain steady. \n8-24. Follow-through consists of all actions controlled by the shooter after the bullet \nleaves the muzzle. It is required to complete the shot process. These actions are executed \nin a general sequence: \n Recoil management. This includes the bolt carrier group recoiling \ncompletely and returning to battery.  \n Recoil recovery. Returning to the same pre-shot position and reacquiring the \nsight picture. The shooter should have a good sight picture before and after \nthe shot.  \n Trigger/Sear reset. Once the ejection phase of the cycle of function is \ncomplete, the weapon initiates and completes the cocking phase. As part of \nthe cocking phase, all mechanical components associated with the trigger, \ndisconnect, and sear are reset. Any failures in the cocking phase indicate a \nweapon malfunction and require the shooter to take the appropriate action. \nThe shooter maintains trigger finger placement and releases pressure on the \ntrigger until the sear is reset, demonstrated by a metallic click. At this point \nthe sear is reset and the trigger pre-staged for a subsequent or supplemental \nengagement if needed. \n Sight picture adjustment. Counteracting the physical changes in the sight \npicture caused by recoil impulses and returning the sight picture onto the \ntarget aiming point. \n Engagement assessment. Once the sight picture returns to the original point \nof aim, the firer confirms the strike of the round, assesses the target’s state, \nand immediately selects one of the following courses of action: \n \nSubsequent engagement. The target requires additional (subsequent) \nrounds to achieve the desired target effect. The shooter starts the pre-\nshot process. \n \nSupplemental engagement. The shooter determines the desired target \neffect is achieved and another target may require servicing. The shooter \nstarts the pre-shot process. \n \nSector check. All threats have been adequately serviced to the desired \neffect. The shooter then checks his sector of responsibility for additional \nthreats as the tactical situation dictates. The unit’s SOP will dictate any \nvocal announcements required during the post-shot sequence. \n \nCorrect Malfunction. If the firer determines during the follow-through \nthat the weapon failed during one of the phases of the cycle of function, \nthey make the appropriate announcement to their team and immediately \nexecute corrective action. \n",
    "page: 146, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 8 \n8-8 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nMALFUNCTIONS \n8-25. When any weapon fails to complete any phase of the cycle of function correctly, \na malfunction has occurred. When a malfunction occurs, the Soldier’s priority remains \nto defeat the target as quickly as possible. The malfunction, Soldier capability, and \nsecondary weapon capability determine if, when, and how to transition to a secondary \nweapon system.  \n8-26. The Soldier controls which actions must be taken to ensure the target is defeated \nas quickly as possible based on secondary weapon availability and capability, and the \nlevel of threat presented by the range to target and its capability: \n Secondary weapon can defeat the threat. Soldier transitions to secondary \nweapon for the engagement. If no secondary weapon is available, announce \ntheir status to the small team, and move to a covered position to correct the \nmalfunction. \n \nSecondary weapon cannot defeat the threat. Soldiers quickly move to a \ncovered position, announce their status to the small team, and execute \ncorrective action. \n No secondary weapon. Soldiers quickly move to a covered position, \nannounce their status to the small team, and execute corrective action. \n8-27. The end state of any of corrective action is a properly functioning weapon. \nTypically, the phase where the malfunction occurred within the cycle of function \nidentifies the general problem that must be corrected. From a practical, combat \nperspective, malfunctions are recognized by their symptoms. Although some symptoms \ndo not specifically identify a single point of failure, they provide the best indication on \nwhich corrective action to apply. \n8-28. To overcome the malfunction, the Soldier must first avoid over analyzing the \nissue. The Soldier must train to execute corrective actions immediately without \nhesitation or investigation during combat conditions.  \n8-29. There are two general types of corrective action: \n \nImmediate action – simple, rapid actions or motions taken by the Soldier to \ncorrect basic disruptions in the cycle of function of the weapon. Immediate \naction is taken when a malfunction occurs such that the trigger is squeeze and \nthe hammer falls with an audible “click.” \n \nRemedial action – a skilled, technique that must be applied to a specific \nproblem or issue with the weapon that will not be corrected by taking \nimmediate action. Remedial action is taken when the cycle of function is \ninterrupted where the trigger is squeezed and either has little resistance during \nthe squeeze (“mush”) or the trigger cannot be squeezed. \n8-30. No single corrective action solution will resolve all or every malfunction. Soldiers \nneed to understand what failed to occur, as well as any specific sounds or actions of the \nweapon in order to apply the appropriate correction measures. \n",
    "page: 147, manual name: riflecarbine\nControl \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n8-9 \n8-31. Immediate action can correct rudimentary failures during the cycle of function: \n \nFailure to fire – is when a round is locked into the chamber, the weapon is \nready to fire, the select switch is placed on SEMI or BURST / AUTO, and \nthe trigger is squeezed, the hammer falls (audible click), and the weapon does \nnot fire. \n \nFailure to feed – is when the bolt carrier assembly is expected to move return \nback into battery but is prevented from moving all the way forward. A clear \ngap can be seen between the bolt carrier assembly and the forward edge of \nthe ejection port. This failure may cause a stove pipe or a double feed (see \nbelow). \n \nFailure to chamber – when the round is being fed into the chamber, but the \nbolt carrier assembly does not fully seat forward, failing to chamber the round \nand lock the bolt locking lugs with the barrel extension’s corresponding lugs. \n \nFailure to extract – when either automatically or manually, the extractor \nloses its grip on the cartridge case or the bolt seizes movement rearward \nduring extraction that leaves the cartridge case partially removed or fully \nseated. \n \nFailure to eject – occurs when, either automatically or manually, a cartridge \ncase is extracted from the chamber fully, but does not leave the upper receiver \nthrough the ejection port. \n8-32. Remedial action requires the Soldier to quickly identify one of four issues and \napply a specific technique to correct the malfunction. Remedial action is required to \ncorrect the following types of malfunctions or symptoms: \n \nImmediate action fails to correct symptom – when a malfunction occurred \nthat initiated the Soldier to execute immediate action and multiple attempts \nfailed to correct the malfunction. A minimum of two cycles of immediate \naction should have been completed; first, without a magazine change, and the \nsecond with a magazine change. \n \nStove pipe – can occur when either a feeding cartridge or an expended \ncartridge case is pushed sideways during the cycle of function causing that \ncasing to stop the forward movement of the bolt carrier assembly and lodge \nitself between the face of the bolt and the ejection port.  \n \nDouble feed – occurs when a round is chambered and not fired and a \nsubsequent round is being fed without the chamber being clear. \n \nBolt override – is when the bolt fails to push a new cartridge out of the \nmagazine during feeding or chambering, causing the bolt to ride on top of the \ncartridge. \n \nCharging handle impingement – when a round becomes stuck between the \nbolt assembly and the charging handle where the charging handle is not in \nthe forward, locked position.  \n8-33. Although there are other types of malfunctions or disruptions to the cycle of \nfunction, those listed above are the most common. Any other malfunction will require \nadditional time to determine the true point of failure and an appropriate remedy. \n",
    "page: 148, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 8 \n8-10\nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nNote. When malfunctions occur in combat, the Soldier must announce \nSTOPPAGE or another similar term to their small unit, quickly move to a \ncovered location, and correct the malfunction as rapidly as possible. If the \nthreat is too close to the Soldier or friendly forces, and the Soldier has a \nsecondary weapon, the Soldier should immediately transition to secondary to \ndefeat the target prior to correcting the malfunction. \nRULES FOR CORRECTING A MALFUNCTION \n8-34. To clear a malfunction, the Soldier must—\n\nApply Rule #1. Soldiers must remain coherent of their weapon and continue\nto treat their weapon as if it is loaded when correcting malfunctions.\n\nApply Rule #2. Soldiers must ensure the weapon’s orientation is appropriate\nfor the tactical situation and not flag other friendly forces when correcting\nmalfunctions.\n\nApply Rule #3. Take the trigger finger off the trigger, keep it straight along\nthe lower receiver placed outside of the trigger guard.\n\nDo not attempt to place the weapon on SAFE (unless otherwise noted).\nMost stoppages will not allow the weapon to be placed on safe because the\nsear has been released or the weapon is out of battery. Attempting to place\nthe weapon on SAFE will waste time and potentially damage the weapon.\n\nTreat the symptom. Each problem will have its own specific symptoms. By\nreacting to what the weapon is “telling” the Soldier, they will be able to\nquickly correct the malfunction.\n\nMaintain focus on the threat. The Soldier must keep their head and eyes\nlooking downrange at the threat, not at the weapon. If the initial corrective\naction fails to correct the malfunction, the Soldier must be able to quickly\nmove to the next most probable corrective action.\n\nLook last. Do not look and analyze the weapon to determine the cause of the\nmalfunction. Execute the drill that has the highest probability of correcting\nthe malfunction.\n\nCheck the weapon. Once the malfunction is clear and the threat is\neliminated, deliberately check the weapon when in a covered location for any\npotential issues or contributing factors that caused the malfunction and\ncorrect them.\n",

To perform immediate action, the Soldier instinctively: \n \nHears the hammer fall with an audible “click.” \n \nTaps the bottom of the magazine firmly. \n \nRapidly pulls the charging handle and releases to extract / eject the previous \ncartridge and feed, chamber, and lock a new round. \n \nReassess by continuing the shot process. \nNote. If a malfunction continues to occur with the same symptoms, the \nSoldier will remove the magazine and insert a new loaded magazine, then \nrepeat the steps above. \nPerform Remedial Action \n8-36. To perform remedial action, the Soldier must have a clear understanding of where \nthe weapon failed during the cycle of function. Remedial action executed when one of \nthe following conditions exist: \n \nImmediate action does not work after two attempts. \n \nThe trigger refuses to be squeezed. \n \nThe trigger feels like “mush” when squeezed. \n8-37. When one of these three symptoms exist, the Soldier looks into the chamber area \nthrough the ejection port to quickly assess the type of malfunction. Once identified, the \nSoldier executes actions to “reduce” the symptom by removing the magazine and \nattempting to clear the weapon. Once complete, visually inspect the chamber area, bolt \nface, and charging handle. Then, complete the actions for the identified symptom: \n \nStove pipe – Grasp case and attempt to remove, cycle weapon and attempt to \nfire. If this fails, pull charging handle to the rear while holding case. \n \nDouble-feed - the Soldier must remove the magazine, clear the weapon, \nconfirm the chamber area is clear, secure a new loaded magazine into the \nmagazine well, and chamber and lock a round. \n \nBolt override – Remove magazine. Pull charging handle as far rearward as \npossible. Strike charging handle forward. If this fails, pull charging handle to \nthe rear a second time, use tool or finger to hold the bolt to the rear, sharply \nsend charging handle forward. \n \n \n",

Rapid and continuous firing of several magazines in sequence without cooling, \nwill severely elevate chamber temperatures. While unlikely this elevated temperature \nmay cause a malfunction known as a \"cook-off\". A “cook-off” may occur while the \nround is locked in the chamber, due to excessive heating of the ammunition. Or the rapid \nexposure to the cooler air outside of the chamber, due in part to the change in pressure.  \n8-40. If the Soldier determines that he has a potential “cook-off” situation he should \nleave the weapon directed at the target, or in a known safe direction, and follow proper \nweapons handling procedures, until the barrel of the weapon has had time to cool. If the \nchambered round has not been locked in the chamber for 10 seconds, it should be ejected \nas quickly as possible. If the length of time is questionable or known to be longer than \n10 seconds and it is tactically sound, the Soldier should follow the above procedures \nuntil the weapon is cooled. If it is necessary to remove the round before the weapon has \ntime to cool, the Soldier should do so with care as the ejected round may detonate due \nto rapid cooling in open air. \nWARNING \nAmmunition “cook-off” is not likely in well \nmaintained weapons used within normal training \nand combat parameters.  \nSoldiers and unit leadership need to consider the \ndangers of keeping rounds chambered in \nweapons that have elevated temperatures due to \nexcessive firing. Or clearing ammunition that has \nthe potential to cook-off when exposed to the \ncooler air outside of the chamber.  \nExposure to the colder air outside of the chamber \nhas the potential to cause the “cook-off” of \nammunition. Keeping ammunition chambered in \nseverely elevated temperatures also has the \npotential to cause the “cook-off” of ammunition.  \nNote.

    "page: 153, manual name: riflecarbine\n \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n9-1 \nChapter 9 \nMovement \nThe movement functional element is the process of the Soldier \nmoving tactically during the engagement process. It includes the \nSoldier’s ability to move laterally, forward, diagonally, and in a \nretrograde manner while maintaining stabilization, appropriate aim, \nand control of the weapon. \nProper application of the shot process during movement is vital to \ncombat operations. The most complex engagements involve \nmovement of both Soldier and the adversary. The importance of \nsight alignment and trigger control are at their highest during \nmovement. The movement of the Solider degrades stability, the \nability to aim, and creates challenges to proper trigger control. \nMOVEMENT TECHNIQUES \n9-1. \nTactical movement of the Soldier is classified in two ways: vertical and \nhorizontal. Each require specific considerations to maintain and adequately apply the \nother functional elements during the shot process. \n9-2. \nVertical movements are those actions taken to change their firing posture or \nnegotiate terrain or obstacles while actively seeking, orienting on, or engaging threats. \nVertical movements include actions taken to— \n \nChange between any of the primary firing positions; standing, crouched, \nkneeling, sitting, or prone. \n \nNegotiate stairwells in urban environments. \n \nTravel across inclined or descending surfaces, obstacles, or terrain. \n9-3. \nHorizontal movements are actions taken to negotiate the battlefield while \nactively seeking, orienting on, or engaging threats. There are eight horizontal movement \ntechniques while maintaining weapon orientation on the threat— \n \nForward – movement in a direction directly toward the adversary. \n \nRetrograde – movement rearward, in a direction away from the threat while \nmaintaining weapon orientation on the threat. \n \nLateral right/left – lateral, diagonal, forward, or retrograde movement to \nthe right or left. \n \nTurning left/right/about – actions taken by the Soldier to change the \nweapon orientation left/right or to the rear, followed by the Soldier’s \ndirection of travel turning to the same orientation. \n",
    "page: 154, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 9 \n9-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nFORWARD MOVEMENT \n9-4. \nForward movement is continued progress in a direction toward the adversary or \nroute of march. This is the most basic form of movement during an engagement. \nTECHNIQUE \n9-5. \nDuring forward movement,— \n \nRoll the foot heel to toe to best provide a stable firing platform. \n \nShooting while moving should be very close to the natural walking gait and \ncome directly from the position obtained while stationary. \n \nKeep the weapon at the ready position. Always maintain awareness of the \nsurroundings, both to your left and right, at all times during movement. \n \nMaintain an aggressive position. \n \nThe feet should almost fall in line during movement. This straight-line \nmovement will reduce the arc of movement and visible “bouncing” of the \nsight picture.  \n \nKeep the muzzle of the weapon facing down range toward the expected or \ndetected threat. \n \nKeep the hips as stationary as possible. Use the upper body as a turret, \ntwisting at the waist, maintaining proper platform with the upper body. \nRETROGRADE MOVEMENT \n9-6. \nRetrograde movement is where the orientation of the weapon remains to the \nSoldier’s front while the Soldier methodically moves rearward. \nTECHNIQUE \n9-7. \nDuring retrograde movement, the Soldier should— \n \nTake only one or two steps that will open the distance or reposition the feet. \n \nPlace the feet in a toe to heel manner and drop the center body mass by \nconsciously bending the knees, using a reverse combat glide. \n \nMaintain situational awareness of team members, debris, and terrain. \n \nUse the knees as a shock absorber to steady the body movement to maintain \nthe stability of the upper body, stabilizing the rifle sight(s) on the target.  \n \nEnsure all movement is smooth and steady to maintain stability. \n \nBend forward at the waist to put as much mass as possible behind the weapon \nfor recoil management. \n \nKeep the muzzle oriented downrange toward the expected or detected threat. \n \nKeep the hips as stationary as possible. Use the upper body as a turret, \ntwisting at the waist, maintaining proper platform with the upper body. \n",

In the most extreme \ncases, the target will be offset 90 degrees or more from the direction of movement. \nTECHNIQUE \n9-9. During lateral movement, Soldiers should— \n \nPlace their feet heel to toe and drop their center mass by consciously bending \nthe knees. \n \nUse the knees as a shock absorber to steady the body movement to maintain \nthe stability of the upper body, stabilizing the rifle sight(s) on the target.  \n \nEnsure all movement is smooth and steady to maintain stability. \n \nBend forward at the waist to put as much mass as possible behind the weapon \nfor recoil management. \n \nRoll the foot, heel to toe, as you place the foot on the ground and lift it up \nagain to provide for the smoothest motion possible. \n \nKeep the weapon at the alert or ready carry. Do not aim in on the target until \nready to engage.  \n \nMaintain awareness of the surroundings, both to the left and right, at all times \nduring movement. \n \nTrigger control when moving is based on the wobble area. The Soldier shoots \nwhen the sights are most stable, not based on foot position.  \n \nKeep the muzzle of the weapon facing down range toward the threat. \n \nWhen moving, the placement of the feet should be heel to toe. \n \nDo not overstep or cross the feet, because this can decrease the Soldier’s \nbalance and center of gravity. \n \nKeep the hips as stationary as possible. Use the upper body as a turret, \ntwisting at the waist, maintaining proper platform with the upper body. \nNote. It is more difficult to engage adversaries to the firing side while moving \nlaterally. The twist required to achieve a full 90-degree offset requires proper \nrepetitive training. The basic concept of movement must be maintained, from \nfoot placement to platform. \nTwisting at the waist will not allow the weapon to be brought to a full \n90 degrees off the direction of travel, especially with nonadjustable butt \nstocks. The Soldier will need to drop the non-firing shoulder and roll the \nupper body toward the nonfiring side. This will cause the weapon and upper \nbody to cant at approximately a 45-degree angle, relieving some tension in \nthe abdominal region, allowing the Soldier to gain a few more degrees of \noffset. \n",

Turning movement are used to engage widely dispersed targets in the oblique and \non the flanks. Turning skills are just as valuable in a rapidly changing combat \nenvironment as firing on the move (such as lateral movement) skills are and should only \nbe used with the alert carry.  \n9-11. It does not matter which direction the Soldier is turning or which side is the \nSoldier’s strong side. The Soldier must maintain the weapon at an exaggerated low-alert \ncarry for the duration of the turn. \n9-12. Muzzle awareness must be maintained at all times. Ensure that the muzzle does \nnot begin to come up on target the body is completely turned toward the threat. \n9-13. When executing a turn to either side, the Soldier will— \n \nLook first. Turn head to the direction of the turn first.  \n \nWeapon follows the eyes. The Soldier moves the weapon smoothly to where \nthe eyes go. \n \nFollow with the body. The body will begin movement with the movement \nof the weapon. Soldiers finish the body movement smoothly to maintain the \nbest possible stability for the weapon.  \n \nMaintain situational awareness. The Soldier must be completely aware of \nthe surrounding terrain, particularly for tripping hazards. When necessary, \nSoldiers should visually check their surroundings during the turning action \nand return their vision to the target area as quickly as possible. \n \n \n",

It also includes general ammunition information such as \npackaging, standard and North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n(NATO) marking conventions, the components of ammunition, and \ngeneral principles of operation. The information within this \nappendix is 5.56mm for the M4- and M16-series weapons only. \nSMALL ARMS AMMUNITION CARTRIDGES \nA-1. Ammunition for use in rifles and carbines is described as a cartridge. A small \narms cartridge (see figure A-1) is an assembly consisting of a cartridge case, a primer, a \nquantity of propellant, and a bullet. The following terminology describe the general \ncomponents of all small arms ammunition (SAA) cartridges: \n \nCartridge case. The cartridge case is a brass, rimless, center-fire case that \nprovides a means to hold the other components of the cartridge. \n \nPropellant. The propellant (or powder) provides the energy to propel the \nprojectile through the barrel and downrange towards a target through \ncombustion. \n \nPrimer. The primer is a small explosive charge that provides an ignition \nsource for the propellant. \n \nBullet. The bullet or projectile is the only component that travels to the target. \nNote. Dummy cartridges are composed of a cartridge case and bullet, with no \nprimer or propellant. Some dummy cartridges contain inert granular materials \nto simulate the weight and balance of live cartridges. \n \n \nFigure A-1. Small arms ammunition cartridges \n",
    "page: 158, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix A \nA-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nA-2. There are multiple types of bullets used for various purposes. These include ball, \ntracer, armor-piercing, blank, special ball long range (LR), dummy, and short range \ntraining. \nA-3. The cartridge case is made of steel, aluminum, or a brass combination (70 percent \ncopper and 30 percent zinc) for military use. The M4- and M16-series weapons is a \nrimless cartridge case that provides an extraction groove (shown in figure A-2). These \ncartridge cases are designed to support center-fire operation. \nA-4. Center-fire cases have a centrally located primer well/pocket in the base of the \ncase, which separates the primer from the propellant in the cartridge case. These cases \nare designed to withstand pressures generated during firing and are used for most small \narms. \nA-5. All 5.56mm ammunition uses the rimless cartridge case. A rimless cartridge is \nwhere the rim diameter is the same as the case body, and uses an extractor groove to \nfacilitate the cycle of functioning. This design allows for the stacking of multiple \ncartridges in a magazine. \nA-6. When the round is fired, the cartridge case assists in containing the burning \npropellant by expanding the cartridge case tightly to the chamber walls to provide rear \nobturation. \n \nFigure A-2. Cartridge case \n \n \n \n",
    "page: 159, manual name: riflecarbine\nAmmunition \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nA-3 \nPROPELLANT \nA-7. Cartridges are loaded with various propellant weights that impart sufficient \nvelocity, within safe pressure, to obtain the required ballistic projectile performance. \nThe propellants are either a single-base (nitrocellulose) or double-base (nitrocellulose \nand nitroglycerine) composition.  \nA-8. The propellant (see figure A-3) may be a single-cylindrical or multiple-\nperforation, a ball, or a flake design to facilitate rapid burning. Most propellants are \ncoated to assist the control of the combustion rate. A final graphite coating facilitates \npropellant flow and eliminates static electricity in loading the cartridge. \n \nFigure A-3. Propellant \n \n \n",
    "page: 160, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix A \nA-4 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nPRIMER \nA-9. Center-fire small arms cartridges contain a percussion primer assembly. The \nassembly consists of a brass or gilding metal cup (see figure A-4). The cup contains a \npellet of sensitive explosive material secured by a paper disk and a brass anvil.  \nA-10. The weapon firing pin striking the center of the primer cup base compresses the \nprimer composition between the cup and the anvil. This causes the composition to \nexplode. Holes or vents located in the anvil or closure cup allow the flame to pass \nthrough the primer vent, igniting the propellant. \n \nFigure A-4. 5.56mm primer detail \n \n \n",
    "page: 161, manual name: riflecarbine\nAmmunition \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nA-5 \nBULLET \nA-11. The bullet is a cylindrically shaped lead or alloy projectile that engages with the \nrifling of the barrel. Newer projectiles consist of a copper slug with exposed steel \npenetrator, as with the M855A1. The bullets used today are either lead (lead alloy), or \nassemblies of a jacket and a lead or steel core penetrator. The lead used in lead-alloy \nbullets is combined with tin, antimony or both for bullet hardness. The alloying reduces \nbarrel leading and helps prevent the bullet from striping (jumping) the rifling during \nfiring.  \nA-12. Jacketed bullets (see figure A-5) are used to obtain high velocities and are better \nsuited for semiautomatic and automatic weapons. A bullet jacket may be either gilding \nmetal, gilding metal-clad steel, or copper plated steel. In addition to a lead or steel core, \nthey may contain other components or chemicals that provide a terminal ballistic \ncharacteristic for the bullet type.  \nA-13. Some projectiles may be manufactured from plastic, wax, or plastic binder and \nmetal powder, two or more metal powders, or various combinations based on the \ncartridge’s use. \n \nFigure A-5.

There are seven types of SAA for the M4- and M16-series weapons that are used\nfor training and combat. Each of these ammunition types provides a different capability\nand have specific characteristics. The following are the most common types of\nammunition for the rifle and carbine:\nBALL \nA-15. The ball cartridge (see figure A-6) is intended for use in rifles and carbines against\npersonnel and unarmored targets. The bullet, as designed for general purpose combat\nand training requirements, normally consists of a metal jacket and a lead slug.\nFigure A-6. Ball cartridge \nTRACER (TCR OR T) \nA-16. A tracer round contains a pyrotechnic composition in the base of the bullet to\npermit visible observation of the bullet’s in-flight path or trajectory and point of impact.\n(See figure A-7) The pyrotechnic composition is ignited by the propellant when the\nround is fired, emitting a bright flame visible by the firer. Tracer rounds may also be\nused to pinpoint enemy targets to ignite flammable materials and for signaling purposes.\nFigure A-7. Ball with tracer cartridge \n",

The armor-piercing cartridge (see figure A-8) is intended for use against \npersonnel and light armored and unarmored targets, concrete shelters, and similar bullet-\nresistant targets. The bullet consists of a metal jacket and a hardened steel-alloy core. In \naddition, it may have a lead base filler and/or a lead point filler. \n \nFigure A-8. Armor-piercing cartridge \nSHORT RANGE TRAINING AMMUNITION \nA-18. The short range training ammunition (SRTA) (see figure A-9) cartridges are \ndesigned for target practice where the maximum range is reduced for training purposes. \nThis cartridge ballistically matches the ball cartridge out to 300 meters, and rapidly \ndrops in velocity and accuracy. This allows for installations with restricted training \nrange facilities to continue to operate with accurate munitions. This cartridge is also a \npreferred round when conducting training in a close quarters environment, like a shoot \nhouse or other enclosed training facility. \n \nFigure A-9.

    "page: 164, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix A \nA-8 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nBLANK (BLK) \nA-19. The blank cartridge (see figure A-10) is distinguished by the absence of a bullet \nor projectile. It is used for simulated fire, in training maneuvers, and for ceremonial \npurposes. These rounds consist of a roll crimp (knurl) or cannelure on the body of the \ncase, which holds a paper wad in place instead of a projectile. Newer cartridges have \nrosette crimp (7 petals) and an identification knurl on the cartridge case. \n \nFigure A-10. Blank cartridge \nCLOSE COMBAT MISSION CAPABILITY KIT \nA-20. The close combat mission capability kit (CCMCK) cartridge (see figure A-11) is \nused for training purposes only.  \nA-21. The M4 carbine/M16 rifle conversion adapter kit provides utmost safety, in-\nservice reliability and maintainability. The kit is easy to install with a simple exchange \nof the bolt. It adapts the host weapon to fire unlinked 5.56mm M1042 man-marking \nammunition with the feel and function of live ammunition. The kit includes fail-safe \nmeasures to prevent the discharge of a standard “live” round. \n \nFigure A-11. Close combat mission capability kit cartridge \n",

The dummy cartridge (see figure A-12) is used for practice in loading weapons \nand simulated firing to detect errors in employment skills when firing weapons. This \nround is completely inert and consists only of an empty cartridge case and ball bullet. \nCartridge identification is by means of holes through the side of the case or longitudinal \ncorrugations in the case and by the empty primer pocket. \n \nFigure A-12. Dummy cartridge \nCOLORS, MARKINGS, AND SYMBOLS \nA-23. Small arms ammunition is identifiable by color coding specification per type and \nintended use. Table A-1 describes the general color codes for all types of 5.56mm small \narms ammunition. Table A-2 identifies the color code specifications that are applied to \nthe tip of 5.56mm ammunition. \nA-24. Markings stenciled or stamped on munitions or their containers include all \ninformation needed for complete identification.  \nA-25. Packaging and containers for small arms ammunition are clearly marked with \nstandard NATO symbols identifying the contents of the package by type of ammunition, \nprimary use, and packaging information. The most common NATO symbols are \ndescribed according to Standardization Agreement (STANAG) (see table A-2 on page \nA-11). \nA-26. Small arms ammunition (less than 20mm) is not color-coded under \nMIL-STD-709D. Marking standards for small arms ammunition are outlined in— \n \nTM 9-1305-201-20&P. \n \nTM 9-1300-200. \nA-27.

The profession of arms requires Soldiers to \nunderstand their weapons, how they operate, their functioning, and \ntheir employment.  \nB-1. The flight path of a bullet includes three stages: the travel down the barrel, the\npath through the air to the target, and the actions the bullet takes upon impact with the\ntarget. These stages are defined in separate categories of ballistics; internal, external,\nand terminal ballistics.\nINTERNAL BALLISTICS \nB-2. Internal ballistics – is the study of the propulsion of a projectile. Internal\nballistics begin from the time the firing pin strikes the primer to the time the bullet leaves\nthe muzzle. Once the primer is struck the priming charge ignites the propellant. The\nexpanding gases caused by the burning propellant create pressures which push the bullet\ndown the barrel.

Several key terms are used when discussing the physical actions of internal \nballistics — \n \nBore – the interior portion of the barrel forward of the chamber. \n \nChamber – the part of the barrel that accepts the ammunition for firing. \n \nGrain (gr) – a unit of measurement of either a bullet or a projectile. There \nare 7000 grains in a pound, or 437.5 grains per ounce. \n \nPressure – the force developed by the expanding gasses generated by the \ncombustion (burning) of the propellant. Pressure is measure in pounds per \nsquare inch (psi). \n \nShoulder – the area of the chamber that contains the shoulder, forcing the \ncartridge and projectile into the entrance of the bore at the throat of the barrel. \n \nMuzzle – the end of the barrel.  \n \nThroat – the entrance to the barrel from the chamber.

External ballistics is the study of the physical actions and effects of gravity, drag, \nand wind along the projectile’s flight to the target. It includes only those general physical \nactions that cause the greatest change to the flight of a projectile. (See figure B-2.) \nExternal ballistics begins at shot exit and continues through the moment the projectile \nstrikes the target. \n \nFigure B-2. External ballistic terms \nB-5. The following terms and definitions are used to describe the actions or reactions \nof the projectile during flight. This terminology is standard when dealing with any \nweapon or weapon system, regardless of caliber. (See figure B-3.)  \n \nAxis of the bore (Line of Bore) – the line passing through the center of the \nbore or barrel. \n \nLine of sight (LOS) or gun target line (GTL) – a straight line between the \nsights or optics and the target. This is never the same as the axis of the bore. \nThe LOS is what the Soldier sees through the sights and can be illustrated by \ndrawing an imaginary line from the firer’s eye through the rear and front \nsights out to infinity. The LOS is synonymous with the GTL when viewing \nthe relationship of the sights to a target. \n \nLine of elevation (LE) – the angle represented from the ground to the axis \nof the bore. \n \nBallistic trajectory – the path of a projectile when influenced only by \nexternal forces, such as gravity and atmospheric friction. \n \nMaximum ordinate – the maximum height the projectile will travel above \nthe line of sight on its path to the point of impact. \n \nTime of flight – the time taken for a specific projectile to reach a given \ndistance after firing. \n \n \n",
    "page: 180, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix B \nB-4 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \n \n \nFigure B-3. Trajectory \n \nJump – vertical jump in an upward and rearward direction caused by recoil. \nTypically, it is the angle, measured in mils, between the line of departure and \nthe line of elevation. \n \nLine of departure (LD) – the line the projectile is on at shot exit. \n \nMuzzle – the end of the barrel. \n \nMuzzle velocity or velocity – the velocity of the projectile measured at shot \nexit. Muzzle velocity decreases over time due to air resistance. For small \narms ammunition, velocity (V) is represented in feet per second (f/s). \n \nTwist rate – the rotation of the projectile within the barrel of a rifled weapon \nbased on the distance to complete one revolution. The twist rate relates to the \nability to gyroscopically spin-stabilize a projectile on rifled barrels, \nimproving its aerodynamic stability and accuracy. The twist rate of the M4- \nor M16-series weapon is a right hand, one revolution in every seven inches \nof barrel length (or R 1:7 inches). \n \nShot exit – the moment the projectile clears the muzzle of the barrel, where \nthe bullet is not supported by the barrel. \n \nOscillation – the movement of the projectile in a circular pattern around its \naxis during flight. \n \nDrift – the lateral movement of a projectile during its flight caused by its \nrotation or spin. \n \nYaw – a deviation from stable flight by oscillation. This can be caused by \ncross wind or destabilization when the projectile enters or exits a transonic \nstage. \n \nGrain (gr) – a unit of measurement of either a bullet or a propellant charge. \nThere are 7000 grains in a pound, or 437.5 grains per ounce. \n \nPressure – the force developed by the expanding gases generated by the \ncombustion (burning) of the propellant. For small arms, pressure is measured \nin pounds per square inch (psi). \n \nGravity – the constant pressure of the earth on a projectile at a rate of about \n9.8 meters per second squared, regardless of the projectile’s weight, shape or \nvelocity. Commonly referred to as bullet drop, gravity causes the projectile \nto drop from the line of departure. Soldiers must understand the effects of \ngravity on the projectile when zeroing as well as how it applies to \ndetermining the appropriate hold-off at ranges beyond the zero distance. \n",
    "page: 181, manual name: riflecarbine\nBallistics \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nB-5 \n \nDrag (air resistance) – the friction that slows the projectile down while \nmoving through the air. Drag begins immediately upon the projectile exiting \nthe barrel (shot exit). It slows the projectile’s velocity over time, and is most \npronounced at extended ranges. Each round has a ballistic coefficient (BC) \nthat is a measurement of the projectile’s ability to minimize the effects of air \nresistance (drag) during flight. \n \nTrajectory – the path of flight that the projectile takes upon shot exit over \ntime. For the purposes of this manual, the trajectory ends at the point of \nimpact. \n \nWind – has the greatest variable effect on ballistic trajectories. The effects \nof wind on a projectile are most noticeable in three key areas between half \nand two-thirds the distance to the target: \n \nTime (T) – the amount of time the projectile is exposed to the wind \nalong the trajectory. The greater the range to target, the greater time the \nprojectile is exposed to the wind’s effects.  \n \nDirection – the direction of the wind in relation to the axis of the bore. \nThis determines the direction of drift of the projectile that should be \ncompensated. \n \nVelocity (V) – the speed of the wind during the projectile’s trajectory to \nthe target. Variables in the overall wind velocity affecting a change to \nthe ballistic trajectory include sustained rate of the wind and gust spikes \nin velocity. \nTERMINAL BALLISTICS \nB-6. Terminal ballistics is the science of the actions of a projectile from the time it \nstrikes an object until it comes to rest (called terminal rest). This includes the terminal \neffects that take place against the target. \n \nKinetic Energy (EK) – a unit of measurement of the delivered force of a \nprojectile. Kinetic energy is the delivered energy that a projectile possesses \ndue to its mass and velocity at the time of impact. Kinetic energy is directly \nrelated to the penetration capability of a projectile against the target.  \n \nPenetration – the ability or act of a projectile to enter a target’s mass based \non its delivered kinetic energy. When a projectile strikes a target, the level of \npenetration into the target is termed the impact depth. The impact depth is the \ndistance from the point of impact to the moment the projectile stops at its \nterminal resting place. Ultimately, the projectile stops when it has transferred \nits momentum to an equal mass of the medium (or arresting medium).  \nB-7. Against any target, penetration is the most important terminal ballistic \nconsideration. Soldiers must be aware of the penetration capabilities of their ammunition \nagainst their target, and the most probable results of the terminal ballistics.  \nB-8. The 5.56mm projectile’s purpose is to focus the largest amount of momentum \n(energy) on the smallest possible area of the target to achieve the greatest penetration. \nThey are designed to resist deformation on impact to enter the target’s mass. The steel \n",
    "page: 182, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix B \nB-6 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \ntip of the penetrator allows for reduced deformation through light skin armor or body \narmor, and the heavier steel penetrator allows for increased soft tissue damage. \nACTIONS AFTER THE TRIGGER SQUEEZE \nB-9. Once the trigger is squeezed, the ballistic actions begin. Although not all \nammunition and weapons operate in the same manner, the following list describes the \ngeneral events that occur on the M4- and M16-series weapons when the trigger is \nsqueezed. \n \nThe hammer strikes the rear of the firing pin.  \n \nThe firing pin is pushed forward, striking the cartridge percussion primer \nassembly. \n \nThe primer is crushed, pushing the primer composition through the paper \ndisk, and on to the anvil, detonating the primer composition. \n \nThe burning primer composition is focused evenly through the primer cup \nvent hole, igniting the propellant. \n \nThe propellant burns evenly within the cartridge case. \n \nThe cartridge case wall expand from the pressure of the burning propellant, \nfirmly locking the case to the chamber walls.  \n \nThe expanded cartridge case, held firmly in place by the chamber walls and \nthe face of the bolt provide rear obturation, keeping the burning propellant \nand created expanding gasses in front of the cartridge case. \n \nThe projectile is forced by the expanding gasses firmly into the lands and \ngrooves at the throat of the bore, causing engraving.  \n \nEngraving causes the scoring of the softer outer jacket of the projectile with \nthe lands and grooves of the bore. This allows the projectile to spin at the \ntwist rate of the lands and grooves, and provides a forward obturation seal. \nThe forward obturation keeps the expanding gasses behind the projectile in \norder to push it down the length of the barrel. \n \nAs the propellant continues to burn, the gasses created continue to seek the \npath of least resistance. As the cartridge case is firmly seated and the \nprojectile is moveable, the gas continues to exert its force on the projectile. \n \nOnce the projectile passes the gas port on the top of the barrel, a small amount \nof gas is permitted to escape from propelling the projectile. This escaping gas \nis directed up through the gas port and rearward through the gas tube, \nfollowing the path of least resistance. The diameter of the gas port limits the \namount of gas allowed to escape. \n \nAs the end of the projectile leaves the muzzle, it is no longer supported by \nthe barrel itself. Shot exit occurs. \n \nUpon shot exit, most of the expanding and burning gasses move outward and \naround the projectile, causing the muzzle flash. \n \nAt shot exit, the projectile achieves its maximum muzzle velocity. From shot \nexit until the projectile impacts an object, the projectile loses velocity at a \nsteady rate due to air resistance. \n",
    "page: 183, manual name: riflecarbine\nBallistics \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nB-7 \n \nAs the round travels along its trajectory, the bullet drops consistently by the \neffects of gravity. \n \nAs the actual line of departure is an elevated angle from the line of sight, the \nprojectile appears to rise and then descend. This rise and fall of the projectile \nis the trajectory. \n \nThe round achieves the highest point of its trajectory typically over half way \nto the target, depending on the range to target. The high point is called the \nround’s maximum ordinate or max ord. \n \nFrom the max ord, the projectile descends into the target. \n \nThe round strikes the target at the point of impact, which, depending on the \nfiring event, may or may not be the desired point of impact, and is seldom the \npoint of aim. \nNote. The point of aim and point of impact only occur twice during the \nbullet’s path to the target at distance; once when the trajectory crosses the \nline of sight approximately 25 meters from the muzzle, and again at the zero \ndistance (300 meters for the Army standard zero). \n \nOnce the projectile strikes a target or object, it delivers its kinetic energy \n(force) at the point of impact. \n \nTerminal ballistics begin. \nB-10. Once terminal ballistics begin, no bullets follow the same path or function. \nGenerally speaking, the projectile will penetrate objects where the delivered energy \n(mass times velocity squared, divided by 2) is greater than the mass, density, and area \nof the target at the point of the delivered force. There are other contributing factors, such \nas the angle of attack, yaw, oscillation, and other physical considerations that are not \nincluded in this ballistic discussion. \nSTRUCTURE PENETRATION \nB-11. The following common barriers in built-up areas can prevent penetration by a \n5.56-mm round fired at less than 50 meters (M855) including: \n \nSingle row sandbags. \n \nA 2-inch thick concrete wall (not reinforced with rebar or similar item). \n \nA 55-gallon drum filled with water or sand. \n \nA metal ammunition can filled with sand. \n \nA cinder block filled with sand (the block may shatter). \n \nA plate glass windowpane at a 45-degree angle (glass fragments will be \nthrown behind the glass). \n \nA brick veneer. \nNote. The M855A1 enhanced performance round (EPR) has increased \ncapabilities for barrier penetration compared with M855 as shown above.  \n",
    "page: 184, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix B \nB-8 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nB-12. Although most structural materials repel single 5.56-mm rounds, continued and \nconcentrated firing can breach (penetrate through) some typical urban structures. \nB-13. The best method for breaching a masonry wall is by firing short bursts in a \nU-shaped pattern. The distance from the firer to the wall should be minimized for best \nresults—ranges as close as 25 meters are relatively safe from ricochet.  \nB-14. Ball ammunition and armor-piercing rounds produce almost the same results, but \nare more likely to ricochet to the sides and rearward back at the firer (called spit-back).  \nNote. Soldiers must ensure the appropriate level of personal protective \nequipment is worn when conducting tactical and collective tasks, particularly \nat ranges less than 50 meters.  \nB-15. The 5.56-mm round can be used to create either a loophole (about 7 inches in \ndiameter) or a breach hole (large enough for a man to enter). When used against \nreinforced concrete, the M16 rifle and M249 cannot cut the reinforcing bars. \nSOFT TISSUE PENETRATION \nB-16. A gunshot wound, or ballistic trauma, is a form of physical damage sustained \nfrom the entry of a projectile. The degree of tissue disruption caused by a projectile is \nrelated to the size of the cavities created by the projectile as it passes through the target’s \ntissue. When striking a personnel target, there are two types of cavities created by the \nprojectile; permanent and temporary wound cavities. \nPermanent Wound Cavity \nB-17. The permanent cavity refers specifically to the physical hole left in the tissues of \nsoft targets by the pass-through of a projectile. It is the total volume of tissue crushed or \ndestroyed along the path of the projectile within the soft target. \nB-18. Depending on the soft tissue composition and density, the tissues are either elastic \nor rigid. Elastic organs stretch when penetrated, leaving a smaller wound cavity. Organs \nthat contain dense tissue, water, or blood are rigid, and can shatter from the force of the \nprojectile. When a rigid organ shatters from a penetrating bullet, it causes massive blood \nloss within a larger permanent wound cavity. Although typically fatal, striking these \norgans may not immediately incapacitate the target.  \nTemporary Wound Cavity \nB-19. The temporary wound cavity is an area that surrounds the permanent wound \ncavity. It is created by soft, elastic tissues as the projectile passes through the tissue at \ngreater than 2000 feet per second. The tissue around the permanent cavity is propelled \noutward (stretched) in an almost explosive manner from the path of the bullet. This \nforms a temporary recess or cavity 10 to 12 times the bullet’s diameter.  \nB-20. Tissue such as muscle, some organs, and blood vessels are very elastic and can \nbe stretched by the temporary cavity with little or no damage and have a tendency to \nabsorb the projectile’s energy. The temporary cavity created will slowly reduce in size \n",

Projectiles that do not exceed 2000 feet per second velocity on impact \ndo not provide sufficient force to cause a temporary cavity capable of \nincapacitating a threat. \nB-21. The extent of the cavitation (the bullet’s creation of the permanent and temporary \ncavities) is related to the characteristics of the projectile: \n \nKinetic energy (EK) – the delivered mass at a given velocity. Higher \ndelivered kinetic energy produces greater penetration and tissue damage. \n \nYaw – any yaw at the point of impact increases the projectiles surface area \nthat strikes the target, decreasing kinetic energy, but increasing the \npenetration and cavity size. \n \nDeformation – the physical changes of the projectile’s original shape and \ndesign due to the impact of the target. This increases the projectile’s surface \narea and the size of the cavity created after penetration. \n \nFragmentation – the fracturing of a projectile into multiple pieces or sub-\nprojectiles. The multiple paths of the fragmented sub-projectiles are \nunpredictable in size, velocity, and direction. The bullet jacket, and for some \ntypes of projectiles, the lead core, fracture creating small, jagged, sharp \nedged pieces that are propelled outward with the temporary cavity. \nFragments can sever tissue, causing large, seemingly explosive-type. Bone \nfragments caused by the bullet’s strike can have the same effect. \n \nTumbling – the inadvertent end-over-end rotation of the projectile. As a \nprojectile tumbles as it strikes the target, the bullet travels through the tissues \nwith a larger diameter. This causes a more severe permanent cavity as it \npasses through the soft tissue. A tumbling projectile can change direction \nerratically within the body due to its velocity and tendency to strike dense \nmaterial with a larger surface area.  \nB-22. Once inside the target, the projectile’s purpose is to destroy soft tissues with \nfragmentation. The ball ammunition is designed to not flatten or expand on impact, \nwhich would decrease velocity and delivered energy. For the M855-series cartridge, the \npenetrator tends to bend at the steel-core junction, fracture the weaker jacketed layer, \nand fragment into pieces when striking an object.  \n",
    "page: 186, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix B \nB-10 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nIncapacitation \nB-23. Incapacitation with direct fire is the act of ballistically depriving a target of the \nability, strength, or capability to continue its tactical mission. To assist in achieving the \nhighest probability of incapacitation with a single shot, the projectile is designed with \nthe ability to tumble, ricochet, or fragment after impact.  \nB-24. The projectile or its fragments then must hit a vital, blood-bearing organ or the \ncentral nervous system to effectively incapacitate the threat. The projectile’s limited \nfragmentation potential after entry maximizes the soft tissue damage and increases the \npotential for rapid incapacitation. \nLethal Zones \nB-25. The Soldier’s primary point of aim at any target by default is center of visible \nmass. This allows for a tolerance that includes the greatest margin of error with the \nhighest probability of a first round hit. The combat conditions may require more precise \nfires at partially exposed targets or targets that require immediate incapacitation.  \nB-26. Ideally, the point of aim is anywhere within a primary switch area. This point will \nmaximize the possibility of striking major organs and vessels, rendering a clean, one-\nshot kill (see figure B-4.) \n \n \n",

The head is the most frequently \nmoved body part and are the most difficult to hit with precision. Shots to other exposed \nbody parts, such as the pelvic area, should be considered for the shot.  \nB-28. Shots to the pelvic area are used when the target is not completely visible or when \nthe target is wearing body armor that prevents the Soldier from engaging the primary \nzone. This area is rich in large blood vessels and a shot here has a good possibility of \nimpeding enemy movement by destroying the pelvic or hitting the lower spine. \n \nCircuitry shots (switches).  \n \nHydraulic shots (timers).  \n",
    "page: 188, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix B \nB-12 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nCircuitry Shots (Switches) \nB-29. Circuitry shots, or “switches,” are strikes to a target that deliver its immediate \nincapacitation. Immediate incapacitation is the sudden physical or mental inability to \ninitiate or complete any physical task. To accomplish this, the central nervous system \nmust be destroyed by hitting the brain or spinal column. All bodily functions and \nvoluntary actions cease when the brain is destroyed and if the spinal column is broken, \nall functions cease below the break. \nHydraulic Shots (Timer) \nB-30. Hydraulic shots, or “timers,” are impacts on a target where immediate \nincapacitation is not guaranteed. These types of ballistic trauma are termed “timers” as \nthat after the strike of the bullet, the damage caused requires time for the threat to have \nsufficient blood loss to render it incapacitated. Hydraulic shots, although ultimately \nlethal, allow for the threat to function in a reduced capacity for a period of time.  \nB-31. For hydraulic shots to eliminate the threat, they must cause a 40 percent loss of \nblood within the circulatory system. If the shots do not disrupt that flow at a rapid pace, \nthe target will be able to continue its mission. Once two (2) liters of blood are lost, the \ntarget will transition into hypovolemic shock and become incapacitated. \n \n \n",

It is designed for the advanced shooter; \nhowever, all Soldiers should be familiar with the contents of the \nappendix in order to build their mastery and proficiency with their \nindividual weapon. \nC-1. A complex engagement includes any shot that cannot use the CoVM as the point \nof aim to ensure a target hit. Complex engagements require a Soldier to apply various \npoints of aim (called hold, hold-off, or holds) to successfully defeat the threat.  \nC-2. This appendix builds upon the concepts discussed in Chapter 7, Aim, and only \ninclude topics specific to deliberate hold determinations. These topics are:  \n \nTarget conditions: \n \nRange to target. \n \nMoving targets. \n \nOblique targets. \n \nEnvironmental conditions: \n \nWind. \n \nAngled firing. \n \nCompound conditions: \nC-3. Each of these firing conditions may require the Soldier to determine an \nappropriate aim point that is not the CoVM. During any complex engagement, the \nSoldier serves as the ballistic computer during the shot process. The hold represents a \nrefinement or alteration of the center of visible mass point of aim at the target to \ncounteract certain conditions during a complex engagement for— \n \nRange to target. \n \nLead for targets based on their direction and speed of movement.  \n \nCounter-rotation lead required when the Soldier is moving in the opposite \ndirection of the moving target. \n \nWind speed, direction, and duration between the shooter and the target at \nranges greater than 300 meters. \n \nGreatest lethal zone presented by the target to provide the most probable point \nof impact to achieve immediate incapacitation. \nC-4. The Soldier will apply the appropriate aim (hold) based on the firing instances \npresented. Hold determinations will be discussed in two formats; immediate and \ndeliberate. \n",
    "page: 190, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix C \nC-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nTARGET CONDITIONS \nC-5. Soldiers must consider several aspects of the target to apply the proper point of \naim on the target. The target’s posture, or how it is presenting itself to the shooter, \nconsists of— \n \nRange to target. \n \nNature of the target. \n \nNature of the terrain (surrounding the target). \nRANGE TO TARGET \nC-6. Rapidly determining an accurate range to target is critical to the success of the \nSoldier at mid and extended ranges. There are several range determination methods \nshooters should be confident in applying to determine the proper hold-off for pending \nengagements.  \nDeliberate Range Determination \nC-7. The deliberate methods afford the shooter a reliable means of determining the \nrange to a given target; however, these methods require additional time. (See \nfigure C-1.) With practice and experience, the time to determine the range with these \nmethods is reduced significantly. The various methods of deliberate range determination \nare: \n \nReticle relationship (mil or MOA). \n \nRecognition method. \n \nBracketing method. \n \nHalving method. \n \nFigure C-1.

    "page: 194, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix C \nC-6 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nMOVING TARGETS \nC-11. Moving targets are those threats that appear to have a consistent pace and \ndirection. Targets on any battlefield will not remain stationary for long periods of time, \nparticularly once a firefight begins. Soldiers must have the ability to deliver lethal fires \nat a variety of moving target types and be comfortable and confident in the engagement \ntechniques. There are two methods for defeating moving targets; tracking and trapping. \nTracking Method \nC-12. The tracking method is used for a moving target that is progressing at a steady \npace over a well-determined route. If a Soldier uses the tracking method, he tracks the \ntarget with the rifle’s sight while maintaining sight alignment and a point of aim on or \nahead of (leading) the target until the shot is fired.  \nC-13. When establishing a lead on a moving target, the rifle sights will not be centered \non the target and instead will be held on a lead in front of the target. The basic lead \nformula for moving targets that are generally perpendicular to the shooter (moving \nacross the sector of observation), is— \n \n𝟏\n𝟏𝟎𝟎𝑹(𝟕) = 𝑳  \n𝒐𝒓  \n𝟏\n𝟏𝟎𝟎𝑹𝒂𝒏𝒈𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝑻𝒂𝒓𝒈𝒆𝒕 𝒙 𝟕= 𝑳𝒆𝒂𝒅 𝒊𝒏 𝑰𝒏𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒔 \n \nC-14. This formula is used to determine the baseline lead in the direction of travel of \nthe target when its pace is approximately 3 mph or 4.5 feet per second (fps). Figure°C-5, \non page C-7, shows the application of this formula at a notional moving target: \n \n \n \n",

To execute the tracking method, a Soldier performs the following steps:  \n \nSwing the muzzle of the rifle through the target (from the rear of the target to \nthe front) to the desired lead (point of aim). The point of aim may be on the \ntarget or some point in front of the target depending upon the target's range, \nspeed, and angle of movement. \n \nTrack and maintain focus on the rifle’s sight while acquiring the desired sight \npicture. It may be necessary to shift the focus between the rifle’s sight and \nthe target while acquiring the sight picture, but the focus must be on the rifle’s \nsight when the shot is fired. Engage the target once the sight picture is \nacquired. While maintaining the proper lead,— \n \nFollow-through so the lead is maintained as the bullet exits the muzzle. \n \nContinue to track in case a second shot needs to be fired on the target. \nTrapping Method \nC-16. The trapping method (see figure C-6) is used when it is difficult to track the target \nwith the aiming device, as in the prone or sitting position. The lead required to \neffectively engage the target determines the engagement point and the appropriate hold-\noff.  \n",

With the sights settled, the target moves into the predetermined engagement point \nand creates the desired sight picture. The trigger is pulled simultaneously with the \nestablishment of sight picture. To execute the trapping method, a Soldier performs the \nfollowing steps: \n \nSelect an aiming point ahead of the target – where to set the trap. \n \nObtain sight alignment on the aiming point. \n \nHold sight alignment until the target moves into vision and the desired sight \npicture is established. \n \nEngage the target once sight picture is acquired. \n \nFollow-through so the rifle sights are not disturbed as the bullet exits the \nmuzzle. \n \nFigure C-6.

Threats that are moving diagonally toward or away from the shooter are oblique \ntargets. They offer a unique problem set to shooters where the target may be moving at \na steady pace and direction; however, their oblique posture makes them appear to move \nslower.  \nC-19. Soldiers should adjust their hold-off based on the angle of the target’s movement \nfrom the gun-target line. The following guide (see figure C-7) will help Soldiers \ndetermine the appropriate percentage of hold-off to apply to engage the oblique threats \nas they move. \n \nFigure C-7.

The environment can complicate the shooter’s actions during the shot process\nwith excessive wind or requiring angled firing limited visibility conditions. Soldiers\nmust understand the methods to offset or compensate for these firing occasions, and be\nprepared to apply these skills to the shot process. This includes when multiple complex\nconditions compound the ballistic solution during the firing occasion.\nWIND \nC-21. Wind deflection is the most influential element in exterior ballistics. Wind does\nnot push the projectile causing the actual deflection. The bullet’s tip is influenced in the\ndirection of the wind slightly, resulting in a gradual drift of the bullet in the direction of\nthe wind. The effects of wind can be compensated for by the shooter provided they\nunderstand how wind effects the projectile and the terminal point of impact. The\nelements of wind effects are—\n\nThe time the projectile is exposed to the wind (range).\n\nThe direction from which the wind is blowing.\n\nThe velocity of the wind on the projectile during flight.\nWind Direction and Value \nC-22. Winds from the left cause an effect on the projectile to drift to the right, and winds\nfrom the right cause an effect on the projectile to drift to the left. The amount of the\neffect depends on the time of (projectile’s exposure) the wind speed and direction. To\ncompensate for the wind, the firer must first determine the wind’s direction and value.\n(See figure C-8 on page C-11.)\nC-23. The clock system can be used to determine the direction and value of the wind.\nPicture a clock with the firer oriented downrange towards 12 o’clock.\nC-24. Once the direction is determined, the value of the wind is next. The value of the\nwind is how much effect the wind will have on the projectile. Winds from certain\ndirections have less effect on projectiles. The chart below shows that winds from 2 to\n4°o’clock and 8 to 10 o’clock are considered full-value winds and will have the most\neffect on the projectile. Winds from 1, 5, 7, and 11 o’clock are considered half-value\nwinds and will have roughly half the effect of a full-value wind. Winds from 6 and\n12°o’clock are considered no-value winds and little or no effect on the projectile.\n",

The wind will push the projectile in the direction the wind is blowing (see \nfigure C-9). The amount of effects on the projectile will depend on the time of exposure, \ndirection of the wind, and speed of the wind. To compensate for wind the Soldier uses a \nhold in the direction of the wind. \n \n \n",

    "page: 201, manual name: riflecarbine\nComplex Engagements \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nC-13 \nWind Speed \nC-26. Wind speeds can vary from the firing line to the target. Wind speed can be \ndetermined by taking an average of the winds blowing on the range. The firer’s focus \nshould be on the winds between the firer and the target. The front 1/3 of the trajectory \nplays the most significant role in determining the bullet’s wind drift deflection, but with \nincreasing range, the firer must consider the wind speed at midpoint and the target area \nto make the best overall assessment. \nC-27. The Soldier can observe the movement of items in the environment downrange \nto determine the speed. Each environment will have different vegetation that reacts \ndifferently.  \nC-28. Downrange wind indicators include the following: \n \n0 to 3 mph = Hardly felt, but smoke drifts. \n \n3 to 5 mph = Felt lightly on the face. \n \n5 to 8 mph = Keeps leaves in constant movement. \n \n8 to 12 mph = Raises dust and loose paper. \n \n12 to 15 mph = Causes small trees to sway. \nC-29. The wind blowing at the Soldiers location may not be the same as the wind \nblowing on the way to the target.  \nWind Estimation \nC-30. Soldiers must be comfortable and confident in their ability to judge the effects of \nthe wind to consistently make accurate and precise shots. Soldiers will use wind \nindicators between the Soldier and the target that provide windage information to \ndevelop the proper compensation or hold-off.  \nC-31. To estimate the effects of the wind on the shot, Soldiers need to determine three \nwindage factors: \n \nVelocity (speed). \n \nDirection. \n \nValue.  \nDetermining Wind Drift \nC-32. Once wind velocity, direction, and value have been determined, Soldiers \ndetermine how to compensate for the effects of wind. For the Soldier, there are three \nmethods of determining the appropriate hold-off to adjust for excessive wind; using the \nwind formula, wind estimation, or referencing a generalized ballistic windage chart. \nC-33. Once the range to target and wind speed are known, the formula below is used to \ndetermine drift. The output from the formula is in MOA. The final answer is rounded \noff to make the calculation quicker to perform. This formula (see figure C-10) will allow \nthe Soldier to adjust for the distance that the wind displaces his projectile.  \n \n \n",

The ballistics chart shows the wind drift in inches at ranges from 100 meters –\n300 meters and wind speeds up to 20 mph. The data from the 100-m (meter) line shows\nthat even in a 20-mph wind there is very little deflection of the round. At 300 meters, it\ncan be seen that the same 20-mph wind will blow the bullet 26 inches. This illustrates\nthe fact that the bullet is effected more by the wind the further it starts out from the\ntarget.\nWindage Hold \nC-35. Using a hold involves changing the point of aim to compensate for the wind drift.\nFor example, if wind causes the bullet to drift 12 inches to the left, the aiming point must\nbe moved 12 inches to the right. (See figure C-11 on page C-15.)\n",

The aiming point is center mass of the visual target, allowing for the \ngreatest possibility of impacting the target. The hold off is based on the \ndistance from center mass. Soldiers apply the hold-off creating the new point \nof aim.  \nC-36. Firers must adjust their points of aim into the wind to compensate for its effects. \nIf they miss a distant target and wind is blowing from the right, they should aim to the \nright for the next shot. A guide for the initial adjustment is to split the front sight post \non the edge of the target facing the wind. \nC-37. Newly assigned Soldiers should aim at the target's center of visible mass for the \nfirst shot, and then adjust for wind when they are confident that wind caused the miss. \nExperienced firers should apply the appropriate hold-off for the first shot, but should \nfollow the basic rule—when in doubt, aim at the center of visible mass. \n \n \n",

Firing uphill or downhill at angles greater than 30 degrees, the firer must account \nfor the change in the strike of the round from a horizontal trajectory. Rounds fired at \nexcessive angles at extended ranges beyond the weapon’s zero distance strike high on \nthe target. To compensate for this, firers can rapidly determine a correct firing solution \nusing the Quick High Angle Formula. \nC-39. The first step is to determine the appropriate hold for the range to target beyond \nzero distance. Table C-1 provides the approximate holds for M855A1, 5.56mm, Ball, \nEnhanced Performance Round (EPR) at ranges beyond the Army standard 300 meter \nzero— \nTable C-1.

Next, the firer estimates the angle of fire to either 30, 45, or 60 degrees. The firer \nthen applies that information to the Quick High Angle Formula to determine the \napproximate high angle hold. This formula is built to create a rapid hold adjustment that \nwill get the shot on target. \nC-41. Figure C-12 shows the quick high angle formula with an example in both MOA \nand mils.

The drill structure is standardized for all \nindividual and crew served weapons in order to reinforce the most \ncommon actions all Soldiers need to routinely execute with their \nassigned equipment during training and combat.  \nThese drills are used during Table III of the integrated weapons \ntraining strategy, as well as during routine maintenance, concurrent \ntraining, and during deployments. The drills found within this \nappendix are used to build and maintain skills needed to achieve \nproficiency and mastery of the weapon, and are to be ingrained into \ndaily use with the weapon. \nD-1. Each drill is designed to develop confidence in the equipment and Soldier actions \nduring training and combat operations. As they are reinforced through repetition, they \nbecome second nature to the Soldier, providing smooth, consistent employment during \nnormal and unusual conditions.  \nD-2. The drills provided are designed to build the Soldier’s proficiency with the \nfollowing principles: \n \nMindset – the Soldier’s ability to perform tasks quickly and effectively under \nstress. \n \nEfficiency – ensure the drills require the least amount of movement or steps \nto complete correctly. Make every step count. \n \nIndividual tactics – ensure the drills are directly linked to employment in \ncombat.  \n \nFlexibility – provide drills that are not rigid in execution. Units may alter the \nprocedural steps depending on their equipment, configuration, or tactical \nneed.  \nMINDSET \nD-3. Continuous combat is inherently stressful. It exhausts Soldiers and causes \nphysiological changes that reduce their ability to perform tasks as quickly or effectively \nas necessary. The Soldier’s ability to function under stress is the key to winning battles, \nsince, without the Soldier, weapons and tactics are useless. Individual and unit military \neffectiveness depend on the Soldier’s ability to think clearly, accurately, quickly, all \nwith initiative, motivation, physical strength, and endurance. \n",
    "page: 208, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix D \nD-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nD-4. The impact of physiological changes caused by the stress of combat escalates or \nde-escalates based on the degree of stimulation, causing Soldiers to attain different \nlevels of awareness as events occur in the continually transitioning operational area \naround them. Maintaining a tactical mindset involves understanding one’s level of \nawareness and transitioning between the levels of awareness as the situation requires \nescalation or de-escalation. \nNote. Stress can be countered using the principles associated with Soldier \nresilience and performance enhancement. The Comprehensive Soldier and \nFamily Fitness (CSF2) is designed to increase a Soldier’s ability and \nwillingness to perform an assigned task or mission and enhance his \nperformance by assessing and training mental resilience, physical resilience, \nand performance enhancement techniques and skills. This initiative \nintroduces many resources used to train Soldiers on skills to counter stress. \nFor more information about CSF2, see http://csf2.army.mil/. \nEFFICIENCY \nD-5. Efficiency is defined as the minimization of time or resources to produce a desired \noutcome. Efficient movements are naturally faster than movements that contain \nexcessive or wasteful actions.  \nD-6. By reducing the amount of effort, mental, and/or physical, the movement \nbecomes repeatable and the effect becomes predictable. This allows the Soldier to focus \non the tactics while still maintaining the ability to produce accurate and precise fires. \nINDIVIDUAL TACTICS \nD-7. Individual tactics are actions independent of unit standard operating procedures \n(SOPs) or situations that maximize the Soldier’s chance of survival and victory in a \nsmall arms, direct fire battle.  \nD-8. Examples of individual tactics include use of cover and standoff, or the \nmanipulation of time and space between a Soldier and his enemy. \nFLEXIBILITY \nD-9. The techniques presented in this publication are not meant to be prescriptive, as \nmultiple techniques can be used to achieve the same goal. In fact, there is no singular \n“one size fits all” solution to rifle fire; different types of enemies and scenarios require \nthe use of different techniques.  \nD-10. However, the techniques presented are efficient and proven techniques for \nconducting various rifle-related tasks. Should other techniques be selected, they should \nmeet the following criteria: \n",
    "page: 209, manual name: riflecarbine\nDrills \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nD-3 \nRELIABLE UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS \nD-11. Techniques should be designed for reliability when it counts; during combat. The \ntechnique should produce the intended results without fail, under any conditions and \nwhile wearing mission-essential equipment. \nD-12. It should also be tested under as high stress conditions as allowed in training. \nREPEATABLE UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS \nD-13. As combat is a stressor, a Soldier’s body responds much as it does to any other \nstressful stimulus; physiological changes begin to occur, igniting a variable scale of \ncontrollable and uncontrollable responses based on the degree of stimulation.  \nD-14. The technique should support or exploit the body’s natural reaction to life-\nthreatening stress.  \nEFFICIENCY IN MOTION \nD-15. The technique should be designed to create the greatest degree of efficiency of \nmotion. It should contain only necessary movement. Excessive or unnecessary \nmovement in a fighting technique costs time to execute. In a violent encounter, time can \nmean the difference between life and death. \nD-16. Consider the speed at which violent encounters occur; An unarmed person can \ncover a distance of 20 feet in approximately 1 second. Efficiency decreases the time \nnecessary to complete a task, which enhances the Soldier’s safety. \nDEVELOP NATURAL RESPONSES THROUGH REPETITION \nD-17. When practiced correctly and in sufficient volume, the technique should build \nreflexive reactions that a Soldier applies in response to a set of conditions. Only with \ncorrect practice will a Soldier create the muscle memory necessary to serve him under \nconditions of dire stress. The goal is to create automaticity, the ability to perform an \naction without thinking through the steps associated with the action. \nLEVERAGE OVERMATCH CAPABILITIES \nD-18. Engagements can occur from 0 to 600 meters and any variance in between. Fast \nand efficient presentation of the rifle allows more time to stabilize the weapon, refine \nthe aim, and control the shot required to deliver precise fires. This rapidly moves the \nunit toward the goal of fire superiority and gains/maintains the initiative. Speed should \nbe developed throughout the training cycle and maintained during operations. \nD-19. As distance between the Soldier and a threat decreases, so does the time to engage \nwith well-place lethal fires. As distance increase, the Soldier gains time to refine his aim \nand conduct manipulations.  \n \n \n",

To build the skills necessary to master the functional elements of the shot process, \ncertain tasks are integrated into drills. These drills are designed specifically to capture \nthe routine, critical tasks or actions Soldiers must perform fluently and as a second \nnature to achieve a high level of proficiency.  \nD-21. Drills focus on the Soldier’s ability to apply specific weapons manipulation \ntechniques to engage a threat correctly, overcome malfunctions of the weapon or system, \nand execute common tasks smoothly and confidently.  \nDRILL A – WEAPON CHECK \nD-22. The weapon check is a visual inspection of the weapon by the Soldier. A weapon \ncheck includes at a minimum verifying: \n \nWeapon is clear. \n \nWeapon serial number. \n \nAiming device(s) serial number. \n \nAttachment points of all aiming devices, equipment, and accessories. \n \nFunctions check. \n \nProper location of all attachments on the adaptive rail system. \n \nZero information. \n \nServiceability of all magazines. \nD-23. \nThe weapon check is initiated when first receiving the weapon from the arms \nroom or storage facility. This includes when recovering the weapon when they are \nstacked or secured at a grounded location.  \nD-24. \nUnits may add tasks to Drill A as necessary. Units may direct Soldiers to \nexecute Drill A at any time to support the unit’s mission.  \nDRILL B – SLING/UNSLING OR DRAW/HOLSTER \nD-25. This drill exercises the Soldier’s ability to change the location of the weapon on \ndemand. It reinforces their ability to maintain situational and muzzle awareness during \nrapid changes of the weapon’s sling posture. If also provides a fitment check between \nthe weapon, the Soldier’s load bearing equipment, and the Soldier’s ability to move \nbetween positions while maintaining effective use of the weapon. \nD-26. When conducting this drill, Soldiers should: \n \nVerify the proper adjustment to the sling. \n \nRotate the torso left and right to ensure the sling does not hang up on any \nequipment. \n \nEnsure the weapon does not interfere with tactical movement. \nDRILL C – EQUIPMENT CHECK \nD-27.

This is predominantly an administrative loading function. This allows the Soldier \nto develop reliable loading techniques. \nDRILL E – CARRY (FIVE/THREE) \nD-29. This is a series of five specific methods of carrying the weapon by a Soldier. \nThese five methods are closely linked with range operations in the training environment, \nbut are specifically tailored to combat operations. This drill demonstrates the Soldier’s \nproficiency moving between: \n \nHang. \n \nSafe hang. \n \nCollapsed low ready. \n \nLow ready. \n \nHigh ready (or ready up).  \nD-30. A leader will announce the appropriate carry term to initiate the drill. Each carry \nmethod should be executed in a random order a minimum of three times. \nDRILL F – FIGHT DOWN \nD-31. The Fight Down drill builds the Soldier’s understanding of how to move \neffectively and efficiently between firing postures. This drill starts at a standing position, \nand, on command, the Soldier executes the next lower position or the announced \nposition by the leader. The Fight Down drill exercises the following positions in \nsequence: \n \nStanding. \n \nKneeling. \n \nSitting. \n \nProne. \nD-32. Each position should be executed a minimum of three times. Leaders will use \nDrill F in conjunction with Drill G. \nDRILL G – FIGHT UP \nD-33. The Fight Up drill builds the Soldier’s timing and speed while moving from \nvarious positions during operations. This drill starts in the prone position, and, on \ncommand, the Soldier executes the next higher position or the announced position by \nthe leader.

Leaders will use\nDrill F, Fight Down, in conjunction with Drill G, Fight Up.\nD-35. Leaders may increase the tempo of the drill, increasing the speed the Soldier needs\nto assume the next directed position. After the minimum three iterations are completed\n(Drill F, Drill G, Drill F, Drill G, etc.), the leader may switch between Drill F and G at\nany time, at varying tempo.\nDRILL H – GO-TO-PRONE \nD-36. The Go-To-Prone drill develops the Soldier’s agility when rapidly transitioning\nfrom a standing or crouched position to a prone firing position. Standard time should be\nbelow 2 seconds.\nD-37. Leaders announce the starting position for the Soldier to assume. Once the Soldier\nhas correctly executed the start position to standard, the leader will announce GO TO\nPRONE. This drill should be conducted a minimum of five times stationary and five\ntimes while walking.\nD-38. Leaders should not provide preparatory commands to the drill, and should direct\nthe Soldier to go to prone when it is unexpected or at irregular intervals. Leaders may\nchoose to include a tactical rush with the execution of Drill H.\nDRILL I – RELOAD\nD-39. The Tactical Reload drill is executed when the Soldier is wearing complete load\nbearing equipment. It provides exercises to assure fast reliable reloading through\nrepetition at all firing positions or postures.\nD-40. The Soldier should perform Drill I from each of the following positions a\nminimum of seven times each:\n\nStanding.\n\nSquatting.\n\nKneeling.\n\nProne.\nD-41. Leaders may include other drills while directing Drill I to the Soldier to reinforce\nthe training as necessary.\nDRILL J – CLEAR MALFUNCTION \nD-42. This drill includes the three methods to clear the most common malfunctions on\na rifle or carbine in a rapid manner, while maintaining muzzle and situational awareness.\nSoldiers should perform all three variations of clearing a malfunction based on the\ncommands from their leader.\n",
    "page: 213, manual name: riflecarbine\nDrills \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nD-7 \nD-43. Each of the three variations of Drill J should be executed five times. Once \ncomplete, leaders should incorporate Drill J with other drills to ensure the Soldier can \nexecute the tasks at all positions fluently. \nDRILL K – UNLOAD / SHOW CLEAR \nD-44. This is predominantly an administrative unloading function, and allows the \nSoldier to develop reliable clearing techniques. This drill should be executed in tandem \nwith Drill D, Load. It should be executed a minimum of seven times in order to rotate \nthrough the Soldier’s magazine pouch capacity, and reinforce the use of a “dump pouch” \nor pocket, to retain expended magazines during operations. \nD-45. This drill can be executed without ammunition in the weapon. Leaders may opt \nto use dummy ammunition or spent cartridge cases as desired. In garrison environments, \nLeaders should use Drill K on demand, particularly prior to entering buildings or \nvehicles to reinforce the Soldier’s skills and attention to detail. \n \n \n \n",

Zeroing is a maintenance procedure that is accomplished to \nplace the weapon in operation, based on the Soldier’s skill, \ncapabilities, tactical scenario, aiming device, and ammunition. Its \npurpose is to achieve the desired relationship between the line of \nsight and the trajectory of the round at a known distance. The \nzeroing process ensures the Soldier, weapon, aiming device, and \nammunition are performing as expected at a specific range to target \nwith the least amount of induced errors.  \nFor Soldiers to achieve a high level of accuracy and precision, it is \ncritical they zero their aiming device to their weapon correctly. The \nSoldier must first achieve a consistent grouping of a series of shots, \nthen align the mean point of impact of that grouping to the \nappropriate point of aim. Soldiers use the process described in this \nappendix with their weapon and equipment’s technical manuals to \ncomplete the zeroing task. \nBATTLESIGHT ZERO \nE-1. The term battlesight zero means the combination of sight settings and trajectory\nthat greatly reduces or eliminates the need for precise range estimation, further\neliminating sight adjustment, holdover or hold-under for the most likely engagements.\nThe battlesight zero is the default sight setting for a weapon, ammunition, and aiming\ndevice combination.\nE-2. An appropriate battlesight zero allows the firer to accurately engage targets out\nto a set distance without an adjusted aiming point. For aiming devices that are not\ndesigned to be adjusted in combat, or do not have a bullet drop compensator, such as the\nM68, the selection of the appropriate battlesight zero distance is critical.\nZEROING PROCESS \nE-3. A specific process should be followed when zeroing. The process is designed to\nbe time-efficient and will produce the most accurate zero possible.\nE-4. The zero process includes mechanical zero, laser borelight, 25-m grouping and\nzeroing, and zero confirmation out to 300 meters.\n",
    "page: 216, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix E  \nE-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nNote. Although wind and gravity have the greatest effect on the projectile’s \ntrajectory, air density and elevation must also be taken into consideration.  \nLASER BORELIGHT \nE-5. The borelight is an eye-safe laser that is used to boresight optics, iron sights, and \naiming lasers. The borelight assists the first shot group hitting the 25-m zeroing target \nwhen zeroing the weapon. Using the borelight will save range time and require less \nrounds for the zeroing process. Borelighting is done with a borelight, which is centered \nin the bore of the weapon, and with an offset target placed 10 meters from the muzzle \nof the weapon.  \n25-M GROUPING AND ZEROING \nE-6. After successfully boresighting the weapon, the next step is to perform grouping \nand zeroing exercises. Grouping and zeroing is done at 25 meters on a 25-m zero target \nor at known distance range.  \n25-M GROUPING \nE-7. The goal of the grouping exercise is for the shooter to fire tight shot groups and \nconsistently place those groups in the same location. Tight, consistently placed shot \ngroups show that the firer is applying proper aiming and smooth trigger control before \nstarting the zeroing process. The firer should not start the zeroing process until they have \ndemonstrated their ability to group well. \n25-M ZEROING \nE-8. Once the firer has shown their ability to accurately group, they should begin \nadjusting the aiming device to move the groups to the center of the target. During the \nzeroing process, the firer should attempt to center their groups as much as possible. \nDepending on the aiming device used, there may be a zero offset that needs to be used \nat 25 meters. During the zeroing process it is important that the firer adjusts their groups \nas close to the offset mark as possible. \nZERO CONFIRMATION OUT TO 300 METERS \nE-9. The most important step in the zeroing process is zero confirmation out to 300 \nmeters. Having a 25 m zero does not guarantee a center hit at 300 meters. The only way \nto rely on a 300-m hit, is to confirm a 300-m zero.  \nE-10. Confirmation can be done on any range where Soldiers can see the impacts of \ntheir rounds. Groups should be fired and aiming devices should be adjusted. At a \nminimum, the confirmation should be done at 300 meters. If rounds are available, groups \ncan be fired at various ranges to show the firers where their impact will be.  \nE-11. When confirming zero at ranges past 100 meters, the effects of the wind needs to \nbe considered and acted upon, if necessary. If a zero is confirmed at 300 meters on a \nwindy day, and then the weapon is fired at a later date in different wind conditions or no \nwind at all, the impact will change. (See figure E-1 on page E-3.) \n",

Feedback must be included in all live-fire training. Soldiers must have precise \nknowledge of a bullet strike; feedback is not adequate when bullets from previous firings \ncannot be identified. To provide accurate feedback, trainers ensure that Soldiers \ntriangulate and clearly mark previous shot groups on a zeroing target or receive a hard \ncopy from the tower on an automated range. \nE-13. After zeroing, downrange feedback should be conducted. If modified field fire or \nknown distance ranges are not available, a series of scaled silhouette targets can be used \nfor training on the 25-m range. \nE-14. With the M4- and M16-series of weapons, this range is 25 to 300 meters. This \nmeans, that with a properly zeroed rifle, the firer can aim center mass of a target between \n25 meters and 300 meters and effectively engage it. A properly trained rifleman should \nbe able to engage targets out to 600 meters in the right circumstances.  \n",
    "page: 218, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix E \nE-4\nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nNote. A common misconception is that wearing combat gear will cause the \nzero to change. Adding combat gear to the Soldier's body does not cause the \nsights or the reticle to move. The straight line between the center of the rear \nsight aperture and the tip of the front sight post either intersects with the \ntrajectory at the desired point, or it does not. Soldiers should be aware of their \nown performance, to include a tendency to pull their shots in a certain \ndirection, across various positions, and with or without combat gear. A shift \nin point of impact in one shooting position may not correspond to a shift in \nthe point of impact from a different shooting position.  \nE-15.

    "page: 221, manual name: riflecarbine\nZeroing \n31 August 2017 \nTC 3-22.9, C2 \nE-7 \nE-16. A good zero is necessary to be able to engage targets accurately. Whenever the \nSoldier deploys or does training in a new location, they should confirm the zero on their \nrifle if possible, as elevation, barometric pressure, and other factors will affect the \ntrajectory of a round. There are multitudes of factors that can affect a zero, and the only \nsure way to know where the rounds are going, is to fire the rifle to confirm. \nE-17. The zero on each assigned rifle WILL NOT transfer to another rifle. For example, \nif the windage zero on the Soldier’s iron sights was three minutes (3MOA) left of center, \nputting that same setting on another rifle does not make it zeroed. This is due to the \nmanufacturing difference between the weapons. \nE-18. It is recommended that Soldiers setup their equipment and dry practice in position \nwith gear on before coming to the range.  \nE-19. Standard in Training Commission (STRAC) Department of the Army Pamphlet \n(DA PAM) 350-38 allocates ammunition to conduct zeroing procedures using three-shot \ngroups. The preferred method is to use a five-shot grouping, allowing the firer to more \naccurately analyze their shot group. Figure E-4 shows similar three-shot and five-shot \ngroups with one shot on the right edge of the group. If all the shots were taken into \naccount in the three-shot group, the firer would probably adjust their zero from the right \nedge of the four-cm circle. It is possible that the shot on the right was a poor shot and \nshould not be counted in the group. The five-shot group on right is in the same place as \nthe one on the left with the exception of the one shot out to the right. With four out of \nfive shots in a tight group, the wide shot can be discounted and little or no change to the \nwindage is necessary. \nE-20. Part of the grouping and zeroing process is the marking and analysis of shot \ngroups. \n \nFigure E-4. Grouping \n",
    "page: 222, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix E  \nE-8 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nMARKING THE SHOT GROUP \nE-21. If possible, shot groups should be marked using different colored markers so the \nfirer can track their progress. Figure E-5 shows a technique for marking shot groups on \na zero target. This technique allows the firer and coach to track their progress throughout \nthe grouping and zeroing phase.  \nE-22. All sight adjustments are from the center of the group, called the mean point of \nimpact (MPI), and not from the location of a single shot. When using five-shot group, a \nsingle shot that is outside of the rest of the group should not be counted in the group for \nsight adjustment purposes.  \nNote. This figure depicts the color variations in shades of gray. \n \nFigure E-5. Marking shot groups \n",
    "page: 223, manual name: riflecarbine\nZeroing \n31 August 2017 \nTC 3-22.9, C2 \nE-9 \nE-23. The firer shoots and marks their first shot group with a colored marker. The color \nof the first group is noted by placing a line with that marker next to the 1 on the right \nside of the zero target. Groups are fired and marked until they are consistently in the \nsame location. \nE-24. Each sight adjustment is annotated in the same color as the group that was just \nfired.  \nCOACHING \nE-25. Coaching is the process of having another Soldier observe the firer during the \nfiring process to look for shooting errors that the firer themselves may not consciously \nknow they are making. \nTYPES OF COACHES \nE-26. Firing a rifle properly requires the consistent and proper application of the \nelements of employment. It is about doing the right thing, the same way, every shot. The \nsmall arms trainer is also the validation point for any questions during employment \ntraining. In most cases, once group training is completed, it will be the firer’s \nresponsibility to realize and correct his own firing errors but this process can be made \neasier through the use of a coach. \nE-27. Two types of coaches exist, the experienced coach and the peer coach. Although \neach should execute coaching the same way, experienced coaches have a more thorough \nunderstanding of employment and should have more knowledge and practice in firing \nthan the Soldiers they are coaching. Knowledge and skill does not necessarily come with \nrank therefore Soldiers serving as experienced coaches should be carefully selected for \ntheir demonstrated firing ability and their ability to convey information to firers of \nvarying experience levels. \nEXPERIENCED COACHES \nE-28. Experienced coaches are generally in shorter supply throughout the Army and are \ngenerally outnumbered by less skilled firers. This lack of experienced coaches usually \nleads to one experienced coach watching multiple firers dependent upon the table or \nperiod of employment being fired. It often helps the experienced coach to make notes of \nerrors they observe in shooters and discuss them after firing that group. It is often \ndifficult for the coach to remember the errors that they observe in each and every firer.  \nPEER COACHES \nE-29. Using a peer coach, although generally not as effective as using an experienced \ncoach, is still a very useful technique. The advantage of using a peer coach is two-fold: \na peer coach may use their limited knowledge of employment to observe the firer when \nan experienced coach is not available or is occupied with another firer and can either \ntalk the firer through the shooting errors that they have observed or bring any observed \nshooting errors to the attention of the experienced coach. The other advantage of using \na peer coach is that the peer coach themselves, through the act of coaching, may be able \nto observe mistakes made by the firer and learn from them before making the mistakes \n",
    "page: 224, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix E \nE-10\nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nthemselves. Many people grasp instruction more deeply when they are coaching others \nthan when they are simply told to do something. \nNote. Peer coaches can be limited by their level of training. \nE-30. Except for aiming, the coach can observe most of the important aspects of the\nelements of employment. To determine the unobservable errors of shooting the coach\nand the firer must have an open dialog and there must be a relaxed environment for\nlearning. The firer cannot be hesitant to ask questions of the coach and the coach must\nnot become a stressor during firing. The coach must have the ability to safely move\naround the firer to properly observe. There is no one ideal coaching position. The\nfollowing section will discuss the elements of shooting and how best to observe them as\na coach.\nSTABILIZE \nE-31. For the coach to observe how stable the shooter is, they may have to move to\ndifferent sides of the shooter. To observe the shooter’s non-firing elbow (to ensure it\nmakes contact with the ground), the coach will need to be on the shooter’s non-firing\nside. To observe the cant of the weapon (the sights on the weapon should be pointing\ntowards 12 o’clock position, not 11 or 1 o’clock positions), the coach will need to watch\nthe relationship of the front sight to the barrel from behind the shooter. The coach should\nlook for all the other aspects of good positions as outlined in chapter 6 of this publication.\nThe coach should also observe the total amount of weapon movement on recoil. A good\nstable position will have minimal movement under recoil.\nAIMING \nE-32. Determining the aspects of the firer’s aiming (sight picture, sight alignment, point\nof focus) requires dialogue between the firer and the coach. Often, a shooter will not\nrealize his aiming errors until he discovers them on his own. The only method a coach\nhas to observe aiming errors is to use of an M16 sighting device (A2, left and right,\nDVC-T 7-84), but this device can only be used on rifles with carrying handle sights.\nWithout the use of a sighting device, the coach must rely on drawings, discussions, or\nthe use of an M15A1 aiming card (DVC-T 07-26) to determine where the firer is aiming\non the target, his focus point during firing (which should be the front sight), and where\nhis front sight was at the moment of firing in relation to the rear sight aperture and the\npoint of aim on the target. The technique of having the firer call his shots should also be\nused. This technique involves calling the point on the target where the sights were\nlocated at the moment of firing and matching the point called with the impact locations\non the target. Calling the shot helps the firer learn to focus on the front sight during the\nentire firing process.\nE-33. When optics are being used, the shooter can tell the coach where he was holding.\nThis is of particular importance with the RCO. Coaches must insure the 300m aim point\nis used when zeroing at 25-m.\n",
    "page: 225, manual name: riflecarbine\nZeroing \n31 August 2017 \nTC 3-22.9, C2 \nE-11 \nCONTROL \nE-34. The ideal position to observe trigger squeeze is from the non-firing side because \nthe coach will have a better view of the speed of pull, finger position on the trigger, and \nrelease or pressure on the trigger after firing. The coach can look from behind the shooter \nto observe the barrel for lateral movement caused by slapping the trigger during firing.  \nCOACHING FACTORS \nE-35. All firing happens at the weapon. This means that the coach should be focused \nsolely on the shooter during firing and not on what is happening down range. \nE-36. There is no way for a coach to observe only the bullets impact on target and know \nwhat errors the firer made. The coach must watch the shooter during firing to determine \nerrors and use the impacts to confirm their assumptions.  \nE-37. For a coach to properly observe all aspects of firing they must be able to observe \nthe shooter, safely, from both sides and the back. There is no prescribed coaching \nposition. \nE-38. Coaching requires a relaxed atmosphere with open communication between the \nfirer and the coach. \nSHOT GROUP ANALYSIS \nE-39. Shot group analysis involves the firer correlating the shots on paper with the \nmental image of how the shots looked when fired. An accurate analysis of the shot group \ncannot be made by merely looking at the holes in the paper. It is more important to \nobserve the firer than to try and analyze the target. All firing takes place at the weapon, \nand the holes in the paper are only an indicator of where the barrel was pointed when \nthe rifle was fired. When coaches are analyzing groups, they must question the firer \nabout the group to make a determination of what caused the placement of the shots.  \nE-40. For example, if the firer has a tight group – minus one shot that is well outside of \nthe group, the firer should have observed the outlying shot while firing. The firer would \ndiscount this shot when marking their group. (See figure E-6a and figure E-6b.) If a \ncoach is analyzing the group, the firer would tell them that they performed poorly on the \none shot that is out of the group.  \n \n \n",

Novice shooters may benefit from not marking their own shot group. When \nmarking a shot group an inexperienced or stressed Soldier may unintentionally make \nmental corrections. These mental corrections along with the mechanical corrections to \ntheir weapon will cause further issues during follow on shot groups. The experienced \nSoldier is less likely to make adjustments to their sight placement along with the \nmechanical changes to the weapon, knowing the zero process is aligning the sights to \nthe location of the impact of the rounds. Having a coach or the employment instructor \nsimply inform the Soldier of mechanical changes needed to the aiming device is an \neffective way to accomplish this method.  \nE-42. Observing the shooter must be accomplished before analyzing the target can \nbecome effective. Bullets strung vertically do not necessarily mean a breathing issue, \nnor do bullets strung horizontally absolutely indicate a trigger squeeze problem. Coaches \nmust learn to identify shooter errors during firing and use the bullet’s impacts on target \nto confirm their observations. There are often several firing errors that can be the cause \nof certain misplacements of impacts. The coach has to realize that bullets only go where \n",
    "page: 228, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix E \nE-14\nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nthe barrel is pointed, so he has to determine what happened that caused the barrel to be \npointed in those directions, and those causes can be many. \nE-43. They key to proper coaching is becoming a shooting DETECTIVE. The coach\nneeds to observe the shooter, question the shooter, look at the evidence down range,\nquestion the shooter again, make assumptions based upon the evidence available, and\nthen act upon his assumptions. The coach and shooter must have a free and open dialog\nwith each other in a relaxed atmosphere. Remember if a Soldier learns to shoot poorly\nthey will only be capable of shooting poorly.\nDisplacement of Shots Within a Group (Flyers) \nE-44. The capability of the weapon to shoot groups varies dependent on the number of\nrounds fired through the barrel over its lifetime. The average expected group size is\n1 inch (approximately 2.5 centimeters) at 25 meters; some guns may shoot slightly larger\nthan this. If a shooter is firing groups larger than a normal group size the next step should\nbe to have a known skilled shooter attempt to fire and group with the shooter’s weapon.\nIf a proven skilled shooter is able to fire groups of the normal size it is most likely an\nissue with the original shooter. If however the skilled shooter cannot fire within the\naccepted group size there may be something wrong with the gun or barrel.\nE-45. When looking at groups where there are one to two shots away from the group\nbody (one shot away for a three round group, one or two shots away for a five round\ngroup), the coach must look objectively at the overall consistency of group placement.\nA bad shot or group might not indicate a poor grasp of the elements; every shooter will\nhave a bad shot now and again, and some shooters may even have a bad group now and\nagain. Coaches need to use their experience and determine whether or not the firer had\na bad shot, a bad group, or doesn’t have a clear grasp of the elements and take the\nnecessary steps to get the shooter to the end-state. The coach may have the firer shoot\nagain and ignore the bad group or bad shot, instead hoping that the new group matches\nup with the previous shot groups or the coach may need to pull the shooter off the line\nand cover the basic elements. Contrary to popular belief, having a firer shoot over and\nover again in one sitting, until the firer GETS IT RIGHT is not a highly effective\ntechnique.\nBullets Dispersed Laterally on Target \nE-46. Bullets displaced in this manner could be caused by a lateral movement of the\nbarrel due to an unnatural placement of the trigger finger on the trigger. Reasons for this\ncould include—\n\nThe shooter may be slightly misaligning the sights to the left and right.\n\nThe shooter may have the sights aligned properly but may have trouble\nkeeping the target itself perfectly centered on the tip of the front sight.\n\nShooter may be closing eyes at the moment of firing or flinching.\nBullets Dispersed Vertically on Target \nE-47. Bullets displaced in a vertical manner could be caused by the following:\n",
    "page: 229, manual name: riflecarbine\nZeroing \n31 August 2017 \nTC 3-22.9, C2 \nE-15 \n \nShooter may be misaligning the front sight in the rear sight aperture \nvertically. May be caused by the shooter watching the target instead of the \nfront sight. Happens more frequently from less stable positions (kneeling, \nunsupported positions) due to the natural movement of the weapon. \n \nShooter may have trouble seeing the target and keeping the tip of the front \nsight exactly centered vertically on the target. Coach may consider using a \nlarger target or a non-standard aiming point such as a 5-inch circle. Many \nshooters find it easier to find the center of a circle than a man shaped target. \n \nShooter may not have good support, which causes him to readjust their \nposition every shot and settle with the sights slightly misaligned. \n \nShooter may be flinching or closing eyes at the moment of firing. \n \nShooter may be breathing while firing the rifle. (This is not normally the \ncase, most shooters instinctively hold their breath just before the moment of \nfiring). \nLarge Groups \nE-48. Large groups are most commonly caused by the shooter looking at the target \ninstead of the front sight. This causes the shooter to place the front sight in the center of \nthe target without regard for its location in the rear sight aperture. A small misalignment \nof the sights will result in a large misplacement of shots downrange. \nE-49. Most likely it is not a point of aim issue; most shooters will not fire when their \nproperly aligned sights are pointed all over the target. \nGood Groups That Change Position on the Target \nE-50. When the shooter has good groups but they are located at different positions on \nthe target, there can be a number of reasons. These include the following:  \n \nMay be caused by the shooter properly aligning sights during shooting but \npicking up a different point of aim on the target each time. \n \nMay be caused by the shooter settling into a position with the front sight on \ntarget but the sights misaligned. The shooter maintains the incorrect sight \npicture throughout the group but aligns the sights incorrectly and in a \ndifferent manner during the next group. Tell the firer to focus on the front \nsight and have them check natural point of aim before each group. \n \n \n",

    "page: 31, manual name: iwq\n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \nxxvii \nIntroduction \nTC 3-20.40 describes how a unit builds their unit training plan (UTP) for individual \nweapons. It provides all the information needed to plan, prepare, execute, and assess \nindividual weapons training strategies and certifications. The training strategies \ndescribed follow the progressive and gated structure of the integrated weapons training \nstrategy. This manual defines the Army-standard requirements for individual weapons \nqualification and establishes those qualifications as prerequisites for continued training \nfor either specific capability certification or collective live-fire training. \nTC 3-20.40 composed of four chapters and nine appendixes, and is specifically tailored \nto the training strategy, qualification standards, and various weapons certifications of \ncurrent individually assigned weapons in the Army’s inventory. TC 3-20.40 is \norganized in a progressive manner so that each chapter provides the information a unit \nrequires to plan and prepare for weapons training. The appendixes include the “how \nto” execute the training event according to each weapons training strategy or \ncertification. The appendixes also include essential information concerning \nammunition, forms, and weapons safety. \nTC 3-20.40 applies to all Soldiers, regardless of experience or position, who are \nassigned an individual weapon. This publication is designed specifically for unit \ncommanders, training managers, and staff to tailor small arms training to achieve the \nappropriate level of lethality and proficiency. \nCHAPTERS \nThe chapters provide commanders, staff, and planners with key information about the \nindividual weapons training strategy, how to plan and prepare for each training strategy \nevent, and the resources (facilities, equipment, training aids, devices, simulators, and \nsimulations [known as TADSS], and ammunition) required to train the events to \nstandard.  \nCHAPTER 1 – INDIVIDUAL WEAPONS TRAINING \n\nThis chapter provides an overview of the strategy principles used to develop the integrated\nweapons training strategy in this manual. It describes the training strategy structure used, how that\nstructure is integrated into other weapons, systems, platforms, and maneuver echelon training\nstrategies. It describes the table structure, the purpose for each type of event, and the weapons\nspecifically categorized as individual, crew-served, or special purpose weapons.\n\nIn general terms, this chapter describes the basic planning and preparation of training events to\nmaximize the unit’s training time. It provides examples of how a unit may execute the prerequisite\nto live-fire events and the most efficient and effective manner for those live-fire events.\n\nThe chapter culminates with the individual weapons qualification standards and validation\nprocedures. This section provides the minimum live-fire standards to qualify on an individual\nweapon, provides the rules used to determine when a qualification is no longer valid, and provides\nthe guidelines for using a method of validating existing qualifications for pistols, rifles, and\ncarbines.\n",
    "page: 32, manual name: iwq\nIntroduction \nxxviii \nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \nCHAPTER 2 – UNIT TRAINING PLANS \n\nThis chapter provides information about the unit’s development of individual weapons training\nplans. It includes information about the roles and responsibilities of marksmanship master trainers\n(known as MMT) in the organization, and the skills and function they provide to the organization.\n\nThe chapter includes an outline for developing UTPs. The chapter begins with the commander’s\nassessment of current proficiency, an evaluation of key-leader turbulence, mission essential tasks,\nand warfighting skills. The chapter incorporates the command training guidance into the\ndevelopment process and provides a timeline of key tasks and actions leading up to the weapon’s\ntraining that serve as a planning and preparation guide.\nCHAPTER 3 – RANGE REQUIREMENTS \n\nThis chapter discusses the various Army systems, range facilities, instrumentation, and targetry\nthat support the unit’s weapons training. It highlights individual range requirements that enable\nrealistic, challenging training when using the individual weapons training strategies. It details all\nadditional requirements associated with individual weapons training, qualification, and advanced\nskill or capability certification.\n\nIt provides a reference to the Army’s family of small arms and crew-served range facilities that\nsupport the unit’s weapons training. It identifies which facilities best support each training strategy\nevent, and defines the targetry used in this manual’s training events. It specifies specialty\nequipment or instrumentation for improving lethality for Soldiers who are training for tactical\nemployment of their individual weapons.\n\nIt includes a guideline on how to effectively proof the range facility to ensure the Army-standard\ntarget presentations are provided to the training unit. It establishes the minimum requirements for\nproper target presentations and describes the process to verify those requirements.\nCHAPTER 4 – RANGE OPERATIONS \n\nThis chapter provides information for operating a range facility that supports individual weapons\nin an effective and efficient manner. It provides the procedures, duties, and responsibilities for\nplanning, preparing, and executing small arms live-fire ranges for individual weapons.\n\nThe chapter is designed to enhance the knowledge of the personnel tasked to operate a range for\nthe training unit. The chapter provides a guide for each member of the range support personnel\nteam tasked to run a live-fire event.\n\nThe chapter includes common items used on the ranges, where they are obtained or the\norganization that provides them, and assigns duties and responsibilities for all support personnel.\nThe chapter is designed to assist the unit in conducting live-fire ranges efficiently to achieve the\nbest training for their Soldiers while maximizing the facility to its throughput potential.\nAPPENDIXES \nThe appendixes provide general information on ammunition, how to complete the \nrespective Department of the Army forms used during training, as well as each \nintegrated weapons training strategy guideline for execution. They include some \ncommon certifications for use at the unit level—as prerequisites for higher risk \ncollective training events, advanced skills, or capabilities. These appendixes are \ndesigned to provide the trainer, noncommissioned officer, or range personnel the \ninformation on how to successfully conduct each training strategy event. They outline \npreliminary live-fire requirements, alignment and calibration procedures, and live-fire \nrequirements for each respective individual weapon. \nThe training strategies found in the weapon’s appendixes provide the standard format \nof six tables (events). Each table’s events are explained with all associated resources \nrequired: ranges, simulators, simulations, ammunition, and time, as appropriate. The \n",
    "page: 33, manual name: iwq\nIntroduction \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \nxxix \nweapons appendix is divided into sections, one for each training event (table) for each \nweapons training strategy. Following the military decisionmaking process, each \nsection describes the necessary information to plan, prepare, execute, and assess each \ntraining event. Companies executing the training events apply the eight-step training \nmodel, as appropriate. \nAPPENDIX A – AMMUNITION\nThis appendix provides general information on individual weapon ammunition for training and \ncombat use.

    "page: 35, manual name: iwq\n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n1-1\nChapter 1 \nIndividual Weapons Training \nThis chapter describes how a unit builds their unit training plan (UTP) for individual \nweapons. It follows the progressive and gated structure of the integrated weapons \ntraining strategy (known as IWTS) to describe a general overview of the training events \nfound in each respective weapons training strategy.  \nAlthough this chapter is specific to individual weapons, it is important for units to \nunderstand how the training structure relates to individual, crew-served, and special \npurpose weapons. This chapter provides a brief definition and description of these three \nweapons categories. The individual, crew-served, and special purpose training \nstrategies maximizes the use of training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations in a \nsystematic and progressive manner to increase and sustain Soldier and unit proficiency, \neffectiveness, and lethality. The training strategies are capability-based (weapon / \nsystem, ammunition, optics, Soldier) and maximizes the training resources available.  \nThese strategies are directly synchronized with echelon-based proficiency gates \nestablished in the sustainable readiness model (known as SRM). The strategies meet \nthe established training proficiency gates and standards for weapons proficiency.  \nThis chapter provides Soldiers with the basic information to understand the mechanics \nof individual, crew-served, and special purpose weapons training strategy events. Units \nreference the appropriate appendix for individual weapons or the respective training \ncircular for crew-served and special purpose weapons to develop a comprehensive \nUTP.  \nThe latter portion of this chapter specifically focuses on the IWTS and describes how \nthe strategy is designed for efficient execution and culminates with the qualification, \nvalidation, and certification standards. It describes the strategy structure that enables \nunits to train and qualify Soldiers on their assigned weapons and certify them on all \nassigned devices and equipment. \nSTRATEGY PRINCIPLES \n1-1. The IWTS is a single, overarching strategy based on the training requirements of each weapon, system,\nor unit echelon to achieve combat readiness across the various maneuver formation types. It includes\nindividual, crew-served, and direct-fire crew platforms, and indirect (mortar) fires, as well as small unit\nformations (squads, sections, and platoons), and companies, and battalions. The IWTS includes the training\nand proficiency requirements for the battalion’s staff and their ability to coordinate fires in their operational\nenvironment.\n1-2. These separate training strategies work in a collaborative manner to support all collective live\nenvironment training events that culminate in combined arms live-fire exercises for maneuver company-level\nunits, and the fire coordination exercise at battalion-level. These strategies follow nine specific principles to\nprovide commanders with flexible, tailorable, and effective training events that build the desired level of\nproficiency. The nine strategy principles of the IWTS are described below.\n",
    "page: 36, manual name: iwq\nChapter 1 \n1-2\nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \nFUNDAMENTALS FIRST \n1-3. Fundamental Soldier and military occupational specialty specific skills serve as the foundation of the\nIWTS and must not be overlooked. Soldiers, crews, teams, squads, platoons, companies, and battalions\nachieve the highest level of proficiency when building upon mastery of those foundational skills. The\nstrategies built using the IWTS structure update existing qualification or certification events to ensure critical\nfundamental tasks expected of all Soldiers, crews, teams, and small units are trained and tested first. This\nincludes identifying training gaps, developing solutions, and applying the solutions within the guidelines of\nthe strategy review.\nMAXIMIZE VIRTUAL SYSTEMS \n1-4. Augment the live environment training strategy with an effective and efficient use of available virtual\nsystems to train and prepare Soldiers, leaders, and units for the subsequent progressive live-fire training\nevents. Not all weapons, platforms, or small units have simulations or virtual systems available. Each\nsubordinate training strategy will detail the required or authorized simulation system, as appropriate.\nNote. Simulations are not authorized as a qualification means except certain antitank guided \nmissiles (tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided missile, antitank guided missile and the \nJavelin missile system, for example). This is the exception and not the norm. Units should strive \nto accomplish live-fire events with these systems, when possible. \nSYNCHRONIZED COMPONENTS \n1-5. Each strategy must complement and integrate progressively with higher echelon training strategies.\nFor instance, the sniper team training strategy must seamlessly integrate into squad, platoon, and company\ntraining strategies where a training requirement in the sniper team strategy is supported in the collective small\nunit strategy. Synchronized components allows for effective integration in collective training events to\nmaximize command flexibility. This facilitates a “plug-and-play” capability for the squad and collective\ntraining events. The strategy includes integration of other warfighting functions during the collective training\nevents.\nADAPTABLE TO CHANGE \n1-6. The strategy must easily adapt to current and future Army guidance. The strategy must be able to adjust\nto any future changes or alterations to the SRM, as defined in Army Regulation (AR) 525-29, and meet the\nproficiency reporting requirements detailed in AR 220-1.\nESTABLISH PROGRESSIVE AND GATED EVENTS \n1-7. Gated events are the culminating external evaluations of each strategy that provide an assessment of\noverall proficiency at echelon using a standardized method. The culminating event (or events) establishes the\nprerequisites that must be completed prior to progressing to the live-fire events at the next higher echelon.\nCULMINATE IN COMBINED ARMS COLLECTIVE TRAINING EVENTS \n1-8. Each separate training strategy builds to a culminating collective combined arms live-fire event. This\nfacilitates the “train as you fight” concept across all echelons and formations and provides the commander\nwith the capability to seamlessly integrate combined arms assets and external warfighter functions into\ncollective, combined arms training events.\nNote. Although this publication does not contain any collective live-fire events, the qualifications \nand certifications described are prerequisites to those events. \n",
    "page: 37, manual name: iwq\nIndividual Weapons Training \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n1-3\nFACILITATE RAPID DEPLOYMENT CAPABILITIES \n1-9. The strategy provides a high level of proficiency early in the maneuver training cycle enabling small\nunit through brigade combat team (BCT) decisive action capabilities. This implies successful completion of\n“combat ready” minimum proficiency for an entire BCT within a six-month or less training period.\nPROVIDE COMMANDER FLEXIBILITY \n1-10. Commanders must have the flexibility during collective training to support their directed mission,\nexpected operational environment, and desired force structure. This flexibility does not include whether the\nevent needs to be conducted, but rather facilitates the level of complexity, combined arms integration\nrequirements and options, and identifies various methods to increase the training realism for the commander.\nThe flexibility focuses on how the training replicates the unit’s combat role effectively through scenario\ndevelopment, integration of warfighter functions, and tailored formations during the collective events. This\nenables the commander to define the force structure required to meet the operational needs and trains that\ncustom formation with existing resource authorizations.\nNote. The IWTS and all integrated supporting training strategies are designed for home station \ntraining. Initial entry training and training requirements while deployed in austere environments \nare not described in this manual. \nREINFORCE THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND ETHICAL DECISION MAKING \n1-11. The weapons training events include reinforcement of the rules of engagement (ROE) and ethical\ndecision making concerning the application of lethal force (for example, that all members of the Army\nprofession are expected to live by, adhere to, and uphold the moral principles of the Army ethic). Realistic\ntraining includes moral and ethical decision-making and includes ethical challenges and dilemmas to build\ncritical thinking while employing weapons, systems, or formations during tactical operations.\n1-12. The training strategy includes active and passive decision points for building our trusted Army\nprofessionals who accomplish their missions in the right way—ethically, effectively, and efficiently. The\nstrategy’s training events, particularly during the collective training event, build a shared understanding and\nmutual trust of the leaders and Soldiers necessary to develop cohesive teams of trusted Army professionals.\nSTRATEGY STRUCTURE \n1-13. The IWTS is integrated with the SRM, and as such, is not tied to the fiscal year. The IWTS is composed\nof the critical training events that build toward a known level of training, culminating with qualification for\neach weapon, system, and echelon through the BCT. Other training publications will identify the frequency\nof training based on the unit’s component or mission. For example, DA PAM 350-38 will identify the\nfrequency of the specific event authorized during a fiscal year for both active and reserve components.\n1-14. Units must understand the elements, components, and structure of the IWTS to build the overall\ncomprehensive training strategy. These elements create the basic functionality of the IWTS and are described\nin general terms in this section.\n1-15. Table 1-1, on page 1-4, shows the IWTS structure for all weapons, systems, crews, and collective unit\ntraining strategy through the BCT. While the echelon-based structure provides a sequential list of events, the\ncommander has the flexibility to alter the training sequence, provided the unit completes the described\nprerequisites. The IWTS events listed in this publication are not all encompassing. They are the essential\nhome station training events that create the critical path requirement to achieve unit readiness at echelon.\nUnits may include additional training events in their UTP but must use existing resources or secure additional\nresources from the evaluation commander.\n",

Descriptions of the individual, crew-served, and special purpose weapons are provided in the following\nsections. They are provided to help the unit to visualize the weapons and the standard training structures.\nUnderstanding the definitions of those weapons categories, and understanding which weapons belong in each\ncategory is critical for training, qualifying, certifying, and reporting those outcomes correctly.\nINDIVIDUAL WEAPONS \n1-21. Each individual weapon belongs in a table of organization and equipment (TO&E) / modified table of\norganization and equipment (MTOE) / or table of distribution and allowances and is specifically assigned to\nand operated by a single Soldier (see table 1-4). When more than one individual weapon is assigned to a\nSoldier, one is designated as the primary weapon and the others are designated as secondary weapons.\nSoldiers train through qualification on all individual weapons assigned, regardless of whether the weapons\nare designated as primary or secondary:\n\nPrimary weapon. The individual weapon assigned to a Soldier whose principal function is personal\nprotection, which provides the major direct fire capability during lethal engagements. A Soldier\nonly has one primary weapon.\n\nSecondary weapon. An individual or special purpose weapon assigned or designated to a Soldier\nwhose principal function is increased capability, function, or purpose beyond or instead of the\nprimary weapon. A Soldier may have multiple secondary weapons.\n",

The M249L variant is \nspecifically classified as a crew-served weapon. \nLegend: M249AR – automatic rifle, LIN – line item number, TC – training circular \n1-22. Soldiers may be assigned multiple weapons, not necessarily from the same category (individual,\ncrew-served, or special purpose). Soldiers assigned multiple individual weapons will identify one as the\nprimary weapon and the other as a secondary weapon. Those assignments and designations direct the training\nstrategies the Soldier conducts as part of their overall individual proficiency.\nNote. For example, a Soldier is assigned two individual weapons: an M4 and an M17. The M4 is \nthe primary weapon and the M17 is the secondary weapon. The Soldier must qualify on both \naccording to the Army standard and directed frequency of qualification. \nINDIVIDUAL WEAPONS TABLES \n1-23.

Some tables include subcomponents that serve as a control mechanism during the event or provide\ntraining requirements for additional capabilities. There are two primary subcomponents to individual\nweapons tables—\n\nStages – define specific capabilities that require specific training. Stages may require multiple\nphases (see below) to accomplish the desired training outcomes or proficiency. Not all training\nevents require the use of stages. They are a means of describing the conditions of the firing\nenvironment, typically by visibility, chemical environment, and optical assistance. The common\nstages for individual weapons are—\n\nDay fire.\n\nDay fire, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN).\n",

Some special purpose weapons tables include subcomponents that serve as control mechanisms during\nthe event or provide training requirements for additional capabilities. There are two primary subcomponents\nto special purpose weapons tables—\n\nStages – define specific capabilities that require specific training: visibility, chemical\nenvironment, and optical or sensor assistance. Stages may require multiple phases (see below) to\naccomplish the desired training outcomes or proficiency. Not all training events require the use of\nstages. The stages are a means of describing the conditions of the firing environment, typically by\nvisibility, chemical environment, or optical assistance. The common stages for special purpose\nweapons are—\n\nDay fire.\n\nDay fire, CBRN.\n\nNight fire.\n\nNight fire, CBRN.\n\nAssisted Night Fire.\n\nAssisted Night Fire, CBRN.\n\nPhases – are defined changes to the training event where specific firing postures, level of stability,\nor mechanical engagement techniques require the firer to demonstrate proficiency. Not all tables\ninclude separate phases. The common phases to a table are based on the required firing positions:\n\nProne.\n\nKneeling.\n\nSeated.\n\nStanding (fighting position).\n1-37. Table 1-9, on page 1-12, shows an example of the general table structure with stages and phases for\nshoulder launched munitions. It provides an example of how stages and phases are used in the training\nstrategy.\n",

The individual training strategy is designed to minimize training time, while maximizing resources and\ntraining outcomes for the Soldier. This is done by grouping the prerequisite events and the live-fire events\nfor training in a single training day each, requiring two complete training days. Conducted separately, the\ntraining strategy requires 4.5 training days to complete it to standard.\n1-39. Prerequisites to Live Fire – consist of the following training events—\n\nTable I, Preliminary Marksmanship Instruction and Evaluation (known as PMI&E).\n\nTable II, Preliminary Live-Fire Simulations (known as PLFS).\n\nTable III, Drills.\nNote. Table III, Drills, should be used during the live-fire events as concurrent training. The tasks \nconducted during the drills are directly related to the conduct of fire and conduct of the range.  \n1-40. Live-Fire events – for individual weapons training consist of the following—\n\nTable IV, Basic.\n\nTable V, Practice.\n\nTable VI, Qualification.\nNote. Although Table V is not required, it provides an increased tempo engagement sequence that \ngives the Soldier additional repetitions with immediate action drills during firing. This table is \nspecifically designed to train the Soldier on critical employment skills at a demanding and rigorous \npace that is significantly more challenging than the qualification course of fire.  \nUNIFORM REQUIREMENTS \n1-41. Marksmanship instruction requires keeping Soldiers focused on the training tasks during all\npreparatory training tasks. Commanders select the appropriate minimum uniform to reduce or eliminate\n",
    "page: 47, manual name: iwq\nIndividual Weapons Training \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n1-13\ndistractions for the Soldiers based on their experience level and the tasks trained. The following guide is the \nminimum uniform requirements during weapons training through qualification.  \n\nTable I – Duty uniform.\n\nTables II - VI – Combat uniform, personal protective equipment (PPE) and fighting, load carrying\nas directed by the commander.\n1-42. Commanders ensures all firers on the qualification course of fire have access to the appropriate load\ncarrying equipment, including magazine / ammunition pouches, magazines, holsters, slings, or any other\nweapon specific items. Where Soldiers are not authorized the equipment, the tasked range officer in charge\ncoordinates for sufficient items for the firers use during training.\nPREREQUISITES TO LIVE FIRE \n1-43. The prerequisites to live fire are events designed to reinforce the Soldier’s knowledge of the weapon,\nconduct of fire, weapons safety, ammunition, engagement techniques, immediate action, and other tactical\nemployment skills. These events are completed between T-6 through the live-fire training density execution.\n1-44. The unit is required to maintain the training records for these events for 12-months, and must have the\nability to access them during the live-fire event. The official record of training may not be required for upload\nto the Digital Training Management System (DTMS).\n1-45. There are three prerequisite events within the individual weapons training strategy: PMI&E, PLFS,\nand drills. Additional information is provided in the respective weapon’s training appendix. A brief overview\nof these tasks follows.\nIndividual Weapons, Table I, Preliminary Marksmanship Instruction and Evaluation \n1-46. Individual Weapons, Table I, PMI&E, is a pre-live fire, hands-on evaluation of the Soldiers’\ndemonstrated performance on weaponry tasks, characteristics, capabilities, and function of their assigned\nindividual weapon. It verifies the Soldier’s ability to perform critical tasks, apply immediate and remedial\naction, and employ the weapon safely during training and tactical operations. During Table I, Soldiers must\ndemonstrate proficiency on individual tasks and skills through testable (written) and performance (hands-on)\nevaluation.\nNote. Successful completion of Table I, PMI&E, is required prior to any live-fire event with the \nweapon. \nCommanders may include additional tasks, skills, or drills to the event that directly relate to their \ndesired training objectives. This includes adding specific drills for Soldiers assigned a weapon \ntype for the first time. \nIndividual Weapons, Table II, Preliminary Live-Fire Simulations \n1-47. Individual Weapons, Table II, PLFS, is a simulations-based demonstration of the Soldiers’\nperformance while applying the primary capabilities of their weapon in a virtual environment. Table II is the\nculminating event for the weapon’s simulations training strategy. Table II is a replication (simulation) of the\nweapon’s live-fire qualification course and provides a measured demonstration of the Soldier’s performance\nprior to any live-fire event with the weapon.\nNote. Table II is commonly referred to as a gate to live fire (known as GTLF). Successful \ncompletion of Table II, PLFS, is required prior to any live-fire event with the weapon.  \nIndividual Weapons, Table III, Drills \n1-48. Individual Weapons, Table III, Drills, is a live environment, hands-on training event using training\naids and devices, and may include the use of blank ammunition. Table III is used to train and evaluate the\n",
    "page: 48, manual name: iwq\nChapter 1 \n1-14\nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \nSoldier’s ability to execute critical tasks using their assigned weapon and equipment, during day and night \nconditions, and when operating in a CBRN environment.  \nNote. Successful completion of Table III, Drills, is required prior to any live-fire event with the \nweapon. Failure to conduct Table III will dramatically hinder the Soldiers ability to successfully \nqualify their weapon system. Table III may be executed as concurrent training on all live-fire \nevents (Tables IV through VI). \n1-49. Drills are provided in the Soldier’s tactical employment publication. These drills listed in the weapon’s\nmanual are reinforced during the training strategy. For example, table 1-10 shows the drills crosswalk of\nthose listed in TC 3-22.9 as they are initially trained and reinforced across the training strategy.\nTable 1-10.

For maximum efficiency and throughput, units should consider conducting the prerequisites in round-\nrobin fashion. Table 1-11 shows the prerequisite training rotation.\nTable 1-11.

    "page: 50, manual name: iwq\nChapter 1 \n1-16\nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \n1-51. Commanders have the option to allow their Soldiers who are competent and proficient with their\nweapon system to test out on prerequisites to live-fire. The intent of the prerequisites is to mitigate risk for\nthe commander. The prerequisites (Tables I, II, and III) allow any Soldier to move directly to the test point:\n\nTable I, PMI&E; complete a short, 20 question test.\n\nTable II, PLFS; successfully qualify under the simulated qualification course of fire.\n\nTable III, Drills; demonstrate proficiency to ensure the Soldier can meet the time requirements\nenabling the Soldier’s successful completion of Table VI.\nLIVE-FIRE EVENTS \n1-52. The live-fire events include the full-caliber or subcaliber training events that are conducted in the live\nenvironment under live-fire conditions. They may not be conducted by any Soldier who has not successfully\ncompleting the prerequisites to live-fire between T-6 and execution of the first live-fire event conducted in\nthe training density.\n1-53. The live-fire events are designed to give the unit flexibility by providing multiple types of authorized\nrange facilities that can accommodate the training. Live-fire events also provide a minimal amount of time\nper firing order while maintaining the highest number of repetitions through the core capabilities of the\nweapon system.\n1-54. There are three live-fire events with the individual weapons training strategy: basic, practice, and\nqualification. Additional information is provided in the respective weapon’s training appendix. A brief\noverview of these events follows.\nIndividual Weapons, Table IV, Basic \n1-55. Individual Weapons, Table IV, Basic, is a course of fire using training ammunition on an authorized\nlive-fire facility. This table trains basic skills at a reduced tempo to ensure Soldier mastery of specific basic\nweapon employment skills. This table builds upon those skills trained and tested during Tables I, II, and III.\n1-56. This table includes execution of critical skills in a live environment under live-fire conditions. Table IV\nis commonly the first training event where the Soldier employs the weapon with training ammunition against\nprescribed targetry to a defined standard.\nNote. Table IV is required prior to conducting Table VI, Qualification, for all individual weapons. \nIndividual Weapons, Table V, Practice \n1-57. Individual Weapons, Table V, Practice, is a course of fire using training ammunition on an authorized\nlive-fire facility. This table reinforces the basic skills trained during previous events but increases the tempo\nto expected engagement sequence capabilities to build Soldier mastery. Table V is designed to be more\ndifficult than the qualification course of fire to build confidence in the weapon, ammunition, optics, and\ntraining.\n1-58. This table includes execution of critical skills in a live environment under live-fire conditions. Table V\nprepares the Soldier to employ the weapon against most common threat scenarios using prescribed targetry\nsequences to a required standard.\nNote. Although Table V is not required, it provides an increased tempo engagement sequence that \ngives the Soldier additional repetitions with immediate action drills during firing. This table is \nspecifically designed to train the Soldier on the critical employment skills at a demanding and \nrigorous pace that is significantly more challenging than the qualification course of fire. \n",
    "page: 51, manual name: iwq\nIndividual Weapons Training \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n1-17\nIndividual Weapons, Table VI, Qualification \n1-59. Individual Weapons, Table VI, Qualification, is the Army-standard record course of fire used to\ndetermine the live-fire proficiency of a Soldier employing the weapon. This table includes execution of\ncritical skills. The qualification course of fire uses training ammunition on an authorized live-fire facility, in\na live environment, under live-fire conditions. Table VI builds Soldier experience by tactically employing\nthe weapon against most common threat scenarios with their assigned equipment and attachments. As a\nlive-fire proficiency gate, it provides the commander with an assessment of the Soldier’s overall proficiency\nin employing the weapon.\n1-60. For maximum efficiency and throughput, units should consider conducting the live-fire events on one\nrange facility or two ammunition range footprints. This allows the unit to complete all live-fire events through\nqualification in one training day for up to 200 or more Soldiers.\n1-61. Table 1-12, on page 1-18, provides an example of a unit occupying one range facility, conducting rifle\nand carbine, Tables IV, V, and VI, in one training day. The throughput information used below is provided\nin the rifle and carbine appendix. In this example, the unit can train through qualification for 240 Soldiers in\none training day on one range facility.\nNote. The use of dummy, drilled, inert (known as DDI) to reinforce weapons manipulation may \nnot be used on any Table VI event for any weapon. \n",

    "page: 53, manual name: iwq\nIndividual Weapons Training \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n1-19\nINDIVIDUAL WEAPONS QUALIFICATION STANDARDS \n1-62. Qualifications are the Army’s standard demonstration of proficiency of a weapon, system, platform,\nor small unit, as defined in the appropriate training publication. Qualifications are the required live-fire\nproficiency gates that enable a Soldier to progress to higher echelon live-fire collective events.\nNote. All qualifications and certifications are valid for 12 months. The length of time the \nqualification or certification is valid is the “qualification duration (known as QD).”  \n1-63. Qualifications may be used as prerequisites for additional training, certifications, or functional courses.\nQualifications are externally evaluated by a certified leader, typically the range officer in charge (OIC) or\nrange noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC). The Soldier’s commander verifies the qualifications and\nendorses them prior to entry in DTMS.\n1-64. Soldiers must meet the qualification requirements listed in the appropriate weapons appendix. The unit\ntasked to conduct the event is responsible for recording the respective Table VI, Qualification results on the\ndesignated Department of the Army form. The unit is responsible for annotating the results of their Soldiers’\nqualifications in the DTMS for tracking, reporting, and accountability purposes.\n1-65. The Army standards for individual weapons qualifications and any associated marksmanship badges\nand clasps are listed in table 1-13. The specific task, conditions, and standards for each weapons qualification\nand certification are detailed in the respective appendix at the end of this publication.\nTable 1-13.

Soldiers are not authorized subsequent attempts on the same day. The next opportunity to \nrequalify is during the unit’s designated retraining window, which is no earlier than 45 days from the first \nattempt. \nSoldiers making multiple attempts to qualify during a 45-day period may only be awarded the marksman \nrating. \nLegend: < - less than \n",
    "page: 54, manual name: iwq\nChapter 1 \n1-20\nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \nCONDEMNATION CRITERIA \n1-66. Condemnation criteria (known as CC) are a common set of rules or conditions that apply to any\nqualification or certification. When those conditions are triggered, the qualification or certification expires.\nFor individual, crew-served, and special purpose weapons, the three distinct rules of condemnation criteria\nare time, key leader turnover, or commander’s assessment. All qualifications and certifications are valid\nunless one of the following condemnation criteria exist—\n\nTime – twelve months have elapsed since the date of the qualification or certification was\ncompleted.\n\nKey leader turnover – for the purposes of individual, crew-served, and special purpose weapons,\nkey leader turnover is when a qualified Soldier is no longer assigned to the organization, or the\nqualified Soldier is no longer assigned the weapon.\n\nCommander assessment – the evaluation commander two levels higher determines the subordinate\nunit’s proficiency is no longer at a trained level.\n1-67. There are two distinct beneficiaries of each individual, crew-served, or special purpose qualification:\nthe Soldier and the commander. The Soldiers’ weapons qualifications are recorded in their individual training\nrecord. The commander uses current qualifications to account for training readiness reporting requirements\nof assigned Soldiers with assigned weapons.\nSOLDIER QUALIFICATION DURATION \n1-68. Soldiers’ weapons qualifications are recorded in their individual training record in the DTMS. If the\nqualifications and certifications are still valid and no condemnation criteria have been triggered, the Soldier\nmaintains those qualifications regardless of whether they are currently assigned the weapon or weapon\nsystem.\n1-69. The Soldier qualification condemnation criteria are—\n\nTime – Twelve months have elapsed since successfully completing the qualification.\n\nCommander assessment – Any commander in the chain of command determines the Soldier no\nlonger maintains weapon proficiency for any reason.\nCOMPANY-LEVEL QUALIFICATION DURATION \n1-70. The purpose of qualification or certification for the commander is—\n\nTo provide a risk mitigation tool to ensure the Soldier who is assigned the weapon is competent\nand proficient when employing it.\n\nTo ensure the Soldiers are receiving the adequate training to gain experience through repetition\nand varying engagement scenarios.\n\nTo assist in determining the lethality of subordinate firers in relation to the lethality of the larger\nunit.\n1-71. Commanders can increase their weapons qualifications when newly assigned Soldiers, whose\nqualifications are valid on a weapon type, are assigned the weapon type. This allows the commander to\nleverage the Soldiers’ qualifications through talent management.\n1-72. For reporting purposes at the company level, the qualification condemnation criteria for individual\nweapons are—\n\nTime – Twelve months have elapsed since successfully completing the qualification.\n\nKey leader turnover—\n\nCompany-size units may not consider a Soldier qualified on a weapon type that the Soldier is\nnot assigned.\n\nSoldiers reassigned to another organization retain their qualification for the weapon type as\npart of their individual training record; however, the gaining company-level organization\nassumes responsibility of the qualification and may not count the qualification for reporting\npurposes until the Soldier is assigned that weapon type.\n",
    "page: 55, manual name: iwq\nIndividual Weapons Training \n04 November 2019 \nTC 3-20.40, C1 \n1-21\n\nCommander assessment – Any commander in the chain of command determines the Soldier no\nlonger maintains weapon proficiency for any reason.\nQUALIFICATION REFIRES \n1-73. Qualification of any weapon tests the Soldier’s abilities to employ the weapon effectively. The manual\ndoes not state that multiple attempts cannot be made, but it does restrict the Soldier’s rating when they require\nmultiple attempts.\n1-74. Refires are authorized with realistic and reasonable guidelines. Refires–\n\nMust wait 45 days to INCREASE their qualification rating.\n\nExpert Infantry Badge (known as EIB) training and testing – units provide sufficient time and\nresources to enable the appropriate retraining and refiring.\n\nPromotion points – Soldiers may not use multiple attempts within 44 days of the first attempt\nto increase their potential promotion points awarded.\n\nDepartment of the Army photos – Soldiers may not use multiple attempts within 44 days of\nthe first attempt to increase their qualification rating.\n\nRetraining and refiring may occur the same day; however, the Soldier may only be awarded the\nmarksman qualification badge for the weapon.\n\nRefires within 44 days of the last attempt receive the marksman qualification rating only.\n1-75. This provides a better commander assessment on the overall proficiency of their Soldiers and the\neffectiveness of their past UTPs. The first attempt results of qualification reinforce the training strategy’s\noverall effectiveness, and reinforce unit’s use of the entire strategy. Firing multiple attempts does not build a\nbetter shooter.\nINDIVIDUAL WEAPON VALIDATION \n1-76. Validation is a commander’s option to execute the Army-standard qualification to the minimum\nthreshold requirements to validate an existing qualification—not to create a new qualification rating. Where\nvalidation events are authorized, the threshold requirements are defined in the weapon’s appendix. The\nvalidation event is used in extreme circumstances where the commander requires confirmation of a\nqualification or certification. These circumstances may arise in garrison and operational environments.\nGARRISON REQUIREMENT\n1-77. The validation event is completed using the alternate course of fire (known as ALT-C) as described in\nthe respective appendix. The following rules apply to validation events for use in garrison:\n\nThe first general officer in the unit’s chain of command authorizes the use of the validation event.\n\nUnit assigned as quick reaction force within 90 days.\n\nUnit directed to deploy within 90 days without prior notice.\n\nInstallation range restrictions prohibit standard qualification due to range closures, ammunition\nrestriction, or unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the unit.\n\nUnit location is greater than 180 miles from an Army-standard primary range facility.\n\nOnly one validation is authorized within a 24-month period for any weapon, system, or munition.\n\nSuccessful completion of the validation event extends the existing QD by 12 months.\n\nFailure to successfully complete a validation event after two attempts condemns the qualification\nimmediately.\n\nFailure to validate requires the Soldier to complete the full training strategy to regain their\nqualification status.\nNote. Failing to request or secure appropriate training facilities, ammunition, or other resources \ndoes not justify the use of any validation procedure at home station. \n",
    "page: 56, manual name: iwq\nChapter 1 \n1-22\nTC 3-20.40, C1 \n04 November 2019 \nOPERATIONAL REQUIREMENT \n1-78. The first general officer in the unit’s chain of command may authorize subordinate units to exercise\nthe validation event when deployed to austere environments when one of the following conditions exist:\n\nAvailable range facilities do not support the Army-standard qualification requirements.\n\nLocal range regulations prohibit firing the ammunition type, standard engagement techniques, or\ndo not support the surface danger area.\n\nThe training area available does not meet the most stringent range safety regulations of the Army\nor host nation where the composite surface danger zone (known as SDZ) cannot be sufficiently\nmaintained and secured.\n1-79. The validation event is completed using the alternate course of fire (known as ALT-C) as described in\nthe respective appendix.\nNote. Not all weapons have an authorized validation event or process. Units must refer to the \nweapon’s appendix for additional information. \n1-80. The following rules apply to validation events for operational units while deployed:\n\nThe first general officer in the unit’s chain of command authorizes the use of the validation event.\n\nThe event may only be executed 90 days after mission start through 30 days before mission\ncomplete.\n\nSuccessful completion of the validation event extends the existing QD by 12 months.\n\nOnly one validation is authorized within a 24-month period for any weapon, system, or munition.\n\nFailure to successfully complete a validation event after two attempts condemns the qualification\nimmediately.\n\nFailure to validate requires the Soldier to complete the full training strategy to regain their\nqualification status.\n1-81. Prior to planning, preparing, or executing the ALT-C for reporting (validation) purposes, units must\nensure the Soldiers expected to conduct the training are authorized.\nCERTIFICATIONS \n1-82. For the purposes of individual weapons, certifications are weapons training to a specific quantifiable\nmeasure beyond the Army-standard qualification that enables the weapon’s employment at an advanced level\nor to specific manner, use, or technique. Any Soldier conducting a certification must be weapon system\nqualified.\n1-83. Certifications follow the rules of the QD, including the CC. Units are responsible for managing\ncertifications, as required.\n1-84. Certifications may be used as a prerequisite for additional training, certifications, or functional courses.\nUnits may create their own certification programs to enhance their organization’s tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures, collective training, and other events to mitigate risk during complex live-fire events.\nNote. For example, after completing the M4 Army-standard qualification (Table VI), a unit trains \nand certifies its firers on urban rifle marksmanship (known as URM). Once successfully \ncompleted, firers are certified on that advanced skill.  \nThat URM certification is the prerequisite to training in a live-fire shoot house facility. \n",

It provides information, general guidance, and best practices for \ndeveloping an effective UTP for individual weapons. It includes general concepts of \nthe IWTS and describes how to integrate critical training events into the unit’s weapons \ntraining program. This chapter begins with guidelines for commanders to consider \nwhen selecting a unit training subject matter expert (SME) to advise and assist during \nthe planning, preparation, execution, and assessment of small unit weapons training. It \ndescribes the SME’s duties and responsibilities at various echelons and highlights the \nskills and attributes they provide to the Soldiers and leaders within the organization. \nMARKSMANSHIP MASTER TRAINER \n2-1. The unit must have a knowledgeable SME on the various individual, crew-served, and special purpose\nweapons, systems, optics, pointers, lasers, and attachments. A marksmanship master trainer (known as MMT)\nis an institution-trained and certified Soldier on small arms weapons, ammunition, maintenance of weapon\nsystems, and the various weapon’s unit training programs. These courses include, but are not limited to, the\nMMT course and the heavy weapons leader course. MMT instruction focuses on either individual or\ncrew-served weapons to build weapons proficiency within any organization.\n2-2. The MMT specializes in developing, coordinating, executing, and evaluating UTPs. They have a\ndetailed understanding of the individual and crew-served weapons training strategies and are skilled at\ntraining small unit leaders on how to teach marksmanship skills for those weapons.\n2-3. For units that do not have a MMT assigned or authorized, the commander should select an experienced\nnoncommissioned officer (NCO) who has clearly demonstrated a high level of proficiency training and\nexperience in employing weapons and small units. Typically, the selected Soldier will perform the functions\nof the MMT as an additional duty.\nNote. For simplicity and standardization, the term “MMT” is used throughout this manual to \nidentify a Soldier serving as the unit’s individual and crew-served weapons SME who will \ndevelop, manage, and provide oversight on the weapons, systems, or small unit training programs \nfor the commander. This assigned duty does not remove or replace the roles and responsibilities \nof the leadership, staff, or chain of command during planning, preparation, or execution of \ntraining.  \n2-4. The mission of the MMT is to plan, prepare, execute, and assess the unit’s direct fire training and serve\nas the SME for all individual and crew-served weapons and systems in the unit. The MMT advises the\ncommander on all aspects of direct-fire training, capabilities, tactics, and employment.\n2-5. Unit commanders and staff must be familiar with what their MMT provides in garrison, during training,\nand while deployed. The MMT duties and responsibilities are to—\n\nDevelop and implement live-fire training standard operating procedures (SOPs).\n\nTrack weapons, armament, sensor maintenance tasks, and advise the commander on their status.\n\nMaintain weapon systems firing data.\n\nTrain and certify live-fire evaluators (individual weapons, crew-served weapons, and special\npurpose weapons).\n",

The UTPs are the unit’s overarching plan to attain mission essential and collective task proficiency.\nEvery company-level and above collective training event is created, developed, and executed using the\noperations process (plan-prepare-execute-assess). UTP’s are planned and coordinated in detail well before\nexecution to ensure synchronization with the commander’s intent and expected outcomes.\n2-8. The UTP includes an incremental synchronization of critical actions that must occur to support an\neffective, quality training event. During the planning and preparation process, the unit’s actions are described\nin weekly or monthly increments prior to training execution, depending on the unit’s component.\n2-9. The concepts of the “T-week” (Active Army) and the “T-month” (Reserves) are used to provide a\nsequential framework that ensures all critical actions are completed before and after the training event is\nconducted. This process has to start early enough in the planning cycle to ensure all resources required to\ntrain are present and accounted for as the training begins.\n2-10. All unit or SME actions are described throughout this chapter in “T-increment” fashion. Active\ncomponents will read the “T-increment” number in weeks, and Reserves read the same number as months.\nThis aligns the requirements appropriately in most cases. Installation SOPs may have specific submission\ndates (suspense dates) that are different from those listed. Units must adjust their plan and prepare actions\naccordingly.\n2-11. The T-increment provides the framework to demonstrate the backward planning actions, requirements,\nand considerations necessary for any maneuver tactical or live-fire training event. The T-increment\nframework is descriptive and does not take into account each unit or installation’s particular submission,\nverification, or lock-in requirements.\nNote. The T-increment follows and supports the eight-step training model (company and below \nevents), and the operations process (battalion and above events). It does not replace those \nprocesses and detailed planning actions of the unit. \n2-12. After completing the initial unit proficiency assessment, and establishing the training goals, objectives,\nguidance, and requirements, the commander then designs the unit’s live-fire training plan. The commander\nmust select an approach to training that suits their unit’s needs and that is structured for the average\nproficiency level of his unit.\n",
    "page: 63, manual name: iwq\nUnit Training Plans \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n2-5\n2-13. The commander and the primary trainers must then schedule training that is challenging, rigorous, and\neffective. The unit must develop a training plan that provides sufficient TADSS, resources, training areas,\nand ranges to accomplish their objectives. Training events should be combined (sequential, simultaneous, or\nmulti-echelon events) to maximize efficient use of resources, operating tempo, and training days available.\nCOMMANDER’S ASSESSMENT \n2-14. Guidance from the higher headquarters commander, typically in the form of the command training\nguidance to the subordinate unit commanders, begins the planning process. Before developing the UTP to\nsupport that guidance, the commander must make a complete assessment of the unit’s proficiency, training\nstrengths, weaknesses, and the standards they wish to achieve. Units conduct this analysis through a complete\nmission analysis. This assessment must be comprehensive to best support the design of training plans that\nachieve, improve, or sustain the variety of skills that determine proficiency. Commanders assess and evaluate\nall aspects of training, including the planning, preparation, and execution. Leaders continuously monitor the\nunit’s mission-essential task proficiency to determine a quantifiable snapshot of the unit’s tactical and direct-\nfire proficiency. From this assessment, the unit can develop the UTP to correct deficiencies, and improve\nmastery.\n2-15. The commander assesses the unit’s Soldiers, squads, crews, mortars, and small units for overall\nproficiency using a variety of indicators:\n\nPrevious training assessments.\n\nKey leader turbulence.\n\nResources available (time, ranges, ammunition).\n\nMaintenance status.\n\nMission-essential task assessment.\n\nWarfighting skills.\n2-16. The commander uses the specific task standards whenever possible to measure the demonstrated\nabilities of Soldiers, squads, crews, and elements. Accurate, honest, and objective evaluations are necessary\nto identify where to place training emphasis. Leaders must make on-the-spot corrections and demand\naggressive action to correct training deficiencies.\nPREVIOUS TRAINING ASSESSMENTS \n2-17. The unit reviews the pertinent previous training records to determine proficiency status, strengths,\nweaknesses, and training gaps. The unit identifies prerequisite training events and incorporates them in the\nunit training plan to ensure proper sequencing along the training horizon.\n2-18. Commanders must be aware of the frequency of training required for each strategy. The frequency\ndoes not relate to how long the qualification is valid (termed the “qualification duration”), but the Army’s\nexpectation for that particular component or unit type to conduct the training during the fiscal or training\nyear. The frequency of training through qualification or proficiency impacts the ability of the unit to rapidly\nincrease its training readiness in the shortest amount of time with the least amount of training resources. The\nfrequency of event execution is tied to ensuring the maximum amount of experience is achieved, sustained,\nand maintained, and is described for each weapon, system, platform, and small unit in DA PAM 350-38.\nINDIVIDUAL, CREW-SERVED, AND SPECIAL PURPOSE WEAPONS ASSESSMENT \n2-19. Units ensure all Soldiers have a valid qualification for their assigned, designated, and required\nindividual, crew-served, and special purpose weapons. Qualifications are valid for 12 months, unless\nspecifically stated otherwise in the respective training publication. All assigned, designated, or required\nindividual, crew-served, or special purpose weapons must have a valid qualification prior to entering\ncollective live-fire events.\n2-20. Certain units have additional training requirements once individual or crew-served weapons\nqualification is achieved. These additional training requirements beyond the Army-standard qualification are\n",
    "page: 64, manual name: iwq\nChapter 2 \n2-6\nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \ntermed certifications. They are specific capabilities for a Soldier or team on which they must demonstrate \nproficiency prior to conducting high risk live-fire collective training. Examples of some certifications are—  \n\nThermal weapon sights. This is the boresighting, alignment, zeroing, and tactical employment of\nweapons equipped with various thermal optics.\n\nPointers, illuminators, lasers. This is the boresighting, alignment, zeroing, and tactical\nemployment of weapons equipped with various pointers, illuminators, and lasers.\n\nTransition to secondary weapon. This is the tactical employment of a primary and secondary\nweapon system during short range engagements. This includes transitioning from an individual\nweapon to a special purpose weapon, such as engagements with an M4-series carbine switching\nto an under-mounted 40-millimeter (mm) grenade launcher.\nKEY LEADER TURBULENCE \n2-21. The greatest challenge that a commander must contend with is maintaining qualified and proficient\nunits through personnel changeover, expected or not. The commander must plan for reducing and controlling\nkey leader turbulence to maintain overall unit readiness for the maximum amount of time. Units must actively\nexecute talent, crew, and key leader management skills during the operations process of the UTP. Some\npossible mitigation techniques to personnel management challenges are—\n\nContinually cross-training personnel for replacements. Experienced Soldiers are easier to train\nthan new Soldiers. Units should use harvested training ammunition to train and qualify alternate\nfirers to build experience. Those additional qualified Soldiers provide the commander with\nadditional flexibility managing talent at multiple echelons in their organization.\n\nStabilizing trained SMEs upon graduation. Commanders can encourage attendance at the various\nMMT and heavy weapons leader courses with “graduate stabilization” in the unit. Leaders can\nmaximize the unit’s investment in the Soldier’s expertise by completing unit stabilization requests.\nThis can effectively stabilize the Soldier with the unit for up to 24 months.\n\nConducting small qualification training densities. Unit may choose to conduct qualification events\nwith sister organizations. This is extremely helpful to the unit to maintain and sustain readiness;\nhowever, it may be a significant burden on the sister unit. Advanced planning will limit the number\nof personnel, crews, or squads to qualify, and the unit will be able to plan for reciprocating the\ntraining capability during their UTP.\n2-22. During the key leader turbulence assessment, the commander will be able to identify the most common\ncauses, the impacts on proficiency and readiness, and identify the most probable points of failure in the\ncurrent assignments of key leaders. Commanders can provide guidance to subordinate leaders on the\npreferred methods to mitigate future turbulence.\nRESOURCES AVAILABLE \n2-23. The unit must review available and forecasted training munitions, land and range facility accessibility\nand availability, operating tempo impacts, and other key resources prior to developing the UTP. Leaders\nshould conduct a training area and range reconnaissance to reserve the appropriate training facility or training\narea that meets the commander’s training guidance, training publication guidance for the planned events, and\nthe space to accommodate the entire unit’s personnel and equipment during the training density.\n2-24. Each installation has unique conditions that directly impact their tenant units. Units must pay close\nattention to restrictions, limitations, or additional installation or local coordination requirements for—\n\nPyrotechnics employment. Installation boundaries, seasonal restrictions, and hazards to Soldiers\nare key considerations during UTP development.\n\nTraining cycle rotations. Units must consider the method they will execute the IWTS, and assess\nthe advantages and disadvantages of each, and the impacts those methods will have on their\nresources.\n",
    "page: 65, manual name: iwq\nUnit Training Plans \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n2-7\nMAINTENANCE STATUS \n2-25. A review of the weapon, system, and optic maintenance status is critical to the unit’s success. Units\nshould not overlook the maintenance status of—\n\nWeapon systems. Units must ensure the entire weapon system’s maintenance is reviewed\nholistically to include all the assigned additional authorized equipment, capabilities, and enablers.\nThis includes backup sights, thermal optics, pointers, illuminators, magazines, bipods, tripods, and\nalignment devices.\n\nThermal sensors. This includes thermal weapon sights, charging stations, rechargeable battery\ncapacity, and required generator capabilities.\n\nCBRN detection equipment, protective garments and equipment, and decontamination equipment.\n\nDigital communications systems. This includes software versions, encryption devices, and\ndisplays. Units should conduct a digital communications exercise prior to conducting any\ncompany or higher collective training event.\nMISSION-ESSENTIAL TASK LIST ASSESSMENT \n2-26. Time, resources, and command emphasis must focus on training tasks that support the mission essential\ntask list. Unit leaders should use the appropriate individual tasks that support the training objectives using\nthe following references—\n\nDigital Training Management System.\n\nCombined Arms Training Strategy (CATS).\n\nCentral Army Registry.\n\nSoldier’s handbooks applicable to the training event.\n\nSoldier training publications (training circulars) applicable to the training event.\n\nDA PAM 350-38.\n\nDeployment or mobilization plans.\n\nArmy, area command, and local regulations.\n\nLocal SOP.\n2-27. The training and evaluation outlines for the collective tasks, drills, and individual tasks identified that\nsupport the unit’s mission-essential task list can be accessed through the DTMS, or in the CATS found on\nthe Army Training Network website.\nWARFIGHTING SKILLS \n2-28. Individuals, crews, squads, and platoons must achieve proficiency on tasks that are critical to sustain\nand improve direct-fire training skills. These skills are inherent to training direct fire weapons and\nmaximizing the use and employment of other warfighting functions and combined arms systems. Each\nwarfighter must effectively—\n\nMove:\n\nPerform individual movement techniques.\n\nNavigate from one point to another.\n\nMove under direct fire.\n\nShoot:\n\nPerform disciplined fratricide prevention.\n\nDetect, identify, and classify threats.\n\nMaintain, employ, and engage with assigned weapon or weapon system.\n\nEmploy hand grenades.\n\nCall for fire.\n\nCall for support (close air support, attack aviation, mounted vehicle).\n\nCommunicate:\n",
    "page: 66, manual name: iwq\nChapter 2 \n2-8\nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \n\nPerform voice communications.\n\nPerform digital communications.\n\nUse visual signaling techniques.\n\nSurvive:\n\nMaintain weapons, optic, equipment, and self.\n\nReact to chemical or biological attack or hazard.\n\nPerform immediate lifesaving measures.\n\nPerform counter-improvised explosive device actions.\n\nMaintain situational awareness.\n\nPerform combatives.\n\nAdapt:\n\nAssess and respond to threats (escalation of force using the established ROE).\n\nAdapt to changing operational environments (terrain, visibility, temperature).\n\nGrow professionally and personally.\n\nBattle drills:\n\nReact to contact.\n\nEstablish security.\n\nPerform actions as a member of a mounted patrol.\n\nPerform casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) and medical evacuation (MEDEVAC).\nCOMMAND TRAINING GUIDANCE \n2-29. From the senior commander’s training guidance, commander’s assessment, staff research, and dialog\nwith the subordinate unit commanders, the commander develops his guidance for the unit’s training. The\ncommand training guidance typically identifies the following topics for achieving unit proficiency—\n\nThe unit’s training focus.\n\nThe unit’s capabilities and mission(s).\n\nThe desired readiness level for the unit and subordinate units.\n\nThe unit’s time management cycle.\n\nTraining environments for key training events.\n\nThe unit’s participation in any higher echelon training events or exercises.\n\nExternal evaluation requirements for the unit or in support of other units in the BCT.\n\nOther training guidance specific to achieving unit proficiency.\n2-30. Units will follow the guidelines in FM 7-0 to complete their mission analysis, mission essential task\nselection, and development of their training courses of action. FM 7-0 provides general considerations for\nthe unit’s military decisionmaking process at battalion level, and the company and below troop leading\nprocedures (TLP) for developing their respective UTPs.\nTRAINING GOALS \n2-31. Realistic training is a deliberate practice of conducting individual and collective tasks to enable tactical\nand technical proficiency. Realistic training develops cohesive teams of Army professionals who can improve\nand thrive in ambiguous, complex, and challenging situations. Training goals vary as the local training\nconditions vary. Commanders must design their training according to their available training environments\nand to specifically address their unit proficiency assessments. The goal is to create a training environment\nthat is as realistic and demanding as possible with the resources available. The following goals are set to\nensure successful training—\n\nSet and enforce tough but achievable standards. Tough standards generate effective training and\nloose standards produce weak units. The Soldiers must know when they have done well and when\nthey need additional training and repetition to achieve mastery.\n",
    "page: 67, manual name: iwq\nUnit Training Plans \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n2-9\n\nStart early. All aspects of a training program must be thoroughly coordinated. Planners should\nforecast and request resources and maintenance assistance as early as possible.\n\nBe thorough. Planners should leave nothing to chance, avoid wasting resources and training\nopportunities, and give platoon leaders the guidance and assets needed to train their units\neffectively and efficiently.\n\nBe flexible. Planners should continually update the training program to the changing needs of the\nunit. If assessment and planning stop, the training program stagnates.\n\nTrain continually. Units should train at every opportunity, not just during an intensified period.\nTraining densities in the unit training programs bring units’ proficiency to desired levels and, once\ncompleted, the units train continually to sustain that level of proficiency.\n2-32. The characteristics of quality training become evident once training is planned, prepared for, and\nexecuted. The following characteristics of realistic, quality training from FM 7-0 highlight some\ncharacteristics that the units must strive to develop in their UTP and achieve during execution—\n\nAll leaders are present and engaged.\n\nUnit effectively leverages training resources.\n\nLeader development is a priority.\n\nSenior leaders protect training from distracters.\n\nUnits and Soldiers train with enablers they will operate with during future operations.\n\nTraining environment replicates an operational environment.\n\nAfter action reviews (AARs) are integral to all training.\n\nTraining challenges units and Soldiers intellectually and physically.\n\nTraining is performance-oriented.\n\nTraining is tailored to drive initiative and adaptability.\n\nTraining provides continually changing conditions.\n\nLeaders train one level down.\n\nUnits are evaluated from two levels higher.\n\nUnits and Soldiers train repetitively.\n2-33. Contingency plans and alternate methods of training should be identified when the primary plan cannot\nbe executed. Training time is valuable and should not be lost due to unforeseen factors, whenever possible.\nUnits should consider planning for increased fire danger hazards, firing hour constraints, environmental\nfactors, digging requirements and restrictions, and other impacts to their plans.\nTRAINING HORIZON \n2-34. The training horizon is used to synchronize dedicated training time for organizations and units to train\non mission-essential task list tasks. The training horizon covers the period leading up to at least one readiness\naim point or may cover the entire SRM. Command training guidance is published to provide trainers with\ndetailed information on the unit’s training objective.\n2-35. The following sections provide a general breakdown of major “T-increment” activities to use as a\nguide. It follows the T-increment concept structure found in unit training management, located on the Army\nTraining Network website. The structure will assist in the development of the units’ live-fire density. This\nlist is not all-inclusive. Units must consider installation requirements, Army command directives, and\nguidance from their higher headquarters when planning training.\n2-36. During the planning process for any training event, units conduct a series of tasks to ensure the unit’s\nsuccess. Units and MMTs should review the listed items weekly and report the status during any in-progress\nreviews (IPR) scheduled by the unit. For maneuver unit training, common items to monitor are—\n\nIndividual weapons training and qualification status.\n\nUnit drivers training program.\n\nAmmunition handler certification status.\n\nCombat lifesaver (CLS) certification status.\n",
    "page: 68, manual name: iwq\nChapter 2 \n2-10\nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \n\nRSO and range OIC training and certification status.\n\nSimulations use and progression.\n\nPrerequisite table status.\n\nCurrent evaluators trained and certified in the unit.\n\nSimulations instructor/operator training and certification in the unit.\n\nClass V forecasting, including training ammunition, pyrotechnics, battle effects simulator (known\nas BES) smoke, and other enablers.\n2-37. The initial planning for the training events is the most critical. Tables 2-1 through 2-15 on pages 2-11\nthrough 2-25 show the key planning considerations and execution requirements before a unit’s live-fire. The\nlist is not all-inclusive, and units should reference their installation’s policies and procedures for scheduling\nor securing training resources―this is only a guide.\n2-38. These tables provide a general overview of key planning and preparation functions at the unit level.\nThey are tailored to and are focused on maneuver unit training. The tables follow the operations process and\nintegrate the eight-step training model. Each event’s training timeline is a backwards planning model based\non the training event’s start day, termed “T-execution” or “T-X.” The training density may include multiple\nprogressive training events and may continue for several consecutive weeks based on the tasks being trained.\nT-21 THROUGH T-13 – IDENTIFY REQUIRED TRAINING FACILITIES\n2-39. Table 2-1 shows some key unit and MMT tasks and functions during the T-21 through T-13 period.\nFor the National Guard, these tasks typically are completed during T-12. This timeframe focuses on\nidentifying the major training facilities, ranges, training areas, and ammunition resources required to execute\ntraining. These resources require the longest lead-time to secure for training.\nCAUTION \nTraining timelines are described as time remaining prior to the event \nexecution by component.  \nActive Army unit training timelines = T-weeks. \nReserves unit training timelines = T-months. \n",

Drivers training, ammunition handlers, certified instructor/operators, range\nsafety, and TADSS installation / troubleshooting are just a few of the most common training and certifications\nthat need to be planned for before training execution week.\n2-43. Review and update manning rosters. Units must take appropriate time to determine the formation\ncompositions, key leader assignments, and manning status by assigned position early in the planning cycle.\nThis will reduce the amount of refires, ammunition expenditures, or other resources to ensure an effective\nand efficient training program.\n2-44. Develop tentative training timeline. Developing the tentative training timeline provides backwards\nplanning during the execution weeks of the training event. Units will be able to deconflict training issues\nearlier, and ultimately secure the facilities, training areas, and ranges required at the earliest opportunity.\n2-45. Request land, ranges, and billeting / bivouac areas. During T-21 through T-13, units identify the major\ntraining facilities required to execute their training plans. Units must follow local SOPs to secure facilities,\nwhich may not follow this timeline.\n2-46. Forecast training ammunition. Munitions forecasting conducted according to AR 5-13. For example,\nunits must consider the fire hazards during the training event and coordinate for ball only small arms\nammunition availability. The unit must coordinate closely with the installation ammunition office (or similar\nagency) for sufficient “instead of” quantities, proper ammunition draw procedures, and how to secure any\nnon-resourced ammunition requirements.\n",
    "page: 70, manual name: iwq\nChapter 2 \n2-12\nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \nNote. Active Army units that fail to properly forecast training munitions at T-13 (91 days prior to \ntraining execution) are in jeopardy of not having the desired resources on hand during the training \nevent. To ensure the training munitions are available at the unit level for the training, the unit must \ncomplete their training forecast no later than 90-days from execution.   \n2-47. Identify TADSS needed for event. Each category includes one or more training events that require\nTADSS. The unit must schedule these items well in advance based on the installation’s policies. This\nequipment is provided in finite quantities on the installation. Coordination of accurate training sets required\nallows the installation’s training support center to order, receive, process, and issue additional equipment\nbased on the unit’s requirements.\nT-12 – CONDUCT MISSION ANALYSIS\n2-48. The focus of T-12 is for units to conduct a training event mission analysis and apply the military\ndecisionmaking process and TLP. Gathering the information required to conduct training event planning is\ncritical in developing successful training events. Units capture historical training records, AARs,\nmaintenance status, Soldier and leader certifications, and other key training indicators to support the analysis.\nTable 2-2 shows some of the key unit and MMT tasks that specifically support the mission analysis.\nTable 2-2. T-12 Planning considerations \nT-12\nConduct Training Event Mission Analysis \nUnit Tasks \nMarksmanship Master Trainer Tasks \nUpdate manning roster. \nIdentify and recommend sergeant’s time training topics. \nDetermine sergeant’s time training focus \ntopics. \nPlan evaluator courses. \nConduct staff coordination for live-fire \noperation order annexes and enclosures. \nDevelop live-fire scenarios, as appropriate. \nIdentify Table I evaluators, plan Table I testing periods. \nNote. For Reserve units, all T-21 through T-13 tasks may be executed during T-12 or earlier on \nthe training horizon. Most Reserve units will not have enough information concerning pending \nmissions until 12 months before execution (T-12). Reserve units may have to adjust their planning \nprocess to support their training guidance and mission. \n2-49. Determine sergeant’s time training (known as STT) topics. During T-12, units consider and plan the\navailable STT periods available. The planning should include live-fire individual, buddy team, fire team, and\nsquad tasks.\n2-50. Conduct staff coordination. The MMT assists in the development of the operation order (OPORD)\nwith appropriate enclosures to support the complete training plan. The base OPORD for the training event is\nadministrative, coordinating the actions necessary to manage the preparation, execution, and recovery from\nthe training event. The OPORD should identify the individual and collective tasks to be trained and the\ndesired level of proficiency at the completion of training. The OPORD should address the actions to be taken\nto retrain the tasks during the event if the desired end-state is not achieved.\n2-51. Plan evaluator training. From T-12 through T-1, simulations and gaming training (echelon dependent)\nare conducted monthly. The MMT must monitor the unit’s progress and ensure completion of Table II.\nMMTs should review the certified instructor / operators of the simulations and gaming systems. Units should\nuse certified evaluators for all Table II exercises to build evaluator experience and their AAR techniques.\n2-52. Develop live-fire scenarios. Initial development of the training scenarios is completed during T-12.\nThe MMT must refer to the installation’s range operations regulation to ensure proper lead time is provided\n",
    "page: 71, manual name: iwq\nUnit Training Plans \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n2-13\nfor scenario approval. MMTs must complete a range reconnaissance, map analysis, terrain analysis, and \ntargetry line-of-sight, and ensure the scenario concept can be executed to standard. \n2-53. Identify Table I, PMI&E evaluators. Units must identify all prerequisite training, certifications,\nqualifications, and requirements to support the training. This includes a detailed review that enablers use to\nsupport training. Planning must include training and testing dates for evaluators sufficiently in advance of\ntraining and testing periods for the unit.\nT-11 – REFINE EVENT REQUIREMENTS\n2-54. The focus of T-11 is to refine the event training requirements based on previous training results. (See\ntable 2-3). This focus identifies the training trends and gaps of the unit’s current proficiency to address them\nin the commander’s guidance, as needed. The MMT monitors progress in simulation and gaming systems\nand develops the testing plans to meet the live-fire prerequisites. The unit may develop and publish warning\norders (WARNORDs) to support the upcoming training event, as necessary.\nTable 2-3. T-11 Planning considerations \nT-11\nRefine Event Requirements \nUnit Tasks \nMarksmanship Master Trainer Tasks \nDevelop training event warning order. \nDevelop training synchronization matrix (TSM or \nGUNLINE). \nReview training scenarios. \nReview DA Form 2408-4 (Weapon Record Data), \nas necessary \nSchedule TADSS draw. \nSubmit training scenarios. \nLegend: DA – Department of the Army, GUNLINE – gunnery training synchronization matrix, TADSS – \ntraining aids, devices, simulators, and simulations, TSM – training synchronization matrix \n2-55. Develop training event WARNORD. Units must develop the initial WARNORD for subordinate units.\nInclude as much of the training plan as possible. Units can include topics such as planning guidance for\nconcurrent training, follow-on collective training events, and maneuver training.\n2-56. Review and submit training scenarios. Units or MMT must review scenarios to ensure they support the\ncommander’s guidance and intent. Once complete, the MMT submits the scenarios to range operations and\ncoordinates for the appropriate targetry, BES, and pyrotechnics. Units must refer to local and installation\nrange SOPs to ensure the appropriate lead time is provided for scenario approval.\n2-57. Develop training synchronization matrix. The MMT develops the training synchronization matrix\n(known as TSM) or gunnery training synchronization matrix (known as GUNLINE) for the training event.\nTypically, this is placed on a spreadsheet to show specific ranges or training areas by day, the unit executing\nthe training, and the type of training executed. The TSM / GUNLINE allows synchronization of the unit’s\nefforts, provides a visual representation of the overall live-fire, and supports the tasks to subordinate units\nand specific instructions in the OPORD.\n2-58. Review armament system checks. The MMT must review all DA Form 2408-4 for accuracy and to\nidentify any weapon or system that may reach the threshold tube-wear or barrel-life, as appropriate for the\nunit type.\n2-59. Schedule TADSS draw and issue. The MMT develops and schedules the TADSS plan through the\nlocal training support center. The TADSS plan must include all equipment and devices to support the\nprerequisite and live-training, as appropriate. This may include coordination with range operations to acquire\ntarget lifting mechanisms, scaled or full-scale targetry, BES, generators to run the equipment, and a hand-held\ntargetry controller. Some units may require dummy ammunition that is not supplied by a training support\ncenter but must be ordered through TAMIS or the ammunition supply point on the installation.\n",

The focus of T-10 is to publish the training event WARNORD to allow the supporting staffs and leaders\nto issue initial planning guidance and tasks. The unit determines the operational environment the training\nshould replicate for target type, range to target, scenario development, and any supporting tactical tasks. (See\ntable 2-4).\nTable 2-4. T-10 Planning considerations \nT-10\nPublish Warning Order and Begin Pre-execution Checks \nUnit Tasks \nMarksmanship Master Trainer Tasks \nPublish training event warning order. \nTADSS training and certification. \nVerify class V. \nVerify ranges, training areas, and facilities. \nConfirm TSM / GUNLINE. \nLegend: GUNLINE – gunnery training synchronization matrix, TADSS – training aids, devices, simulators, \nand simulations, TSM – training synchronization matrix \n2-61. Publish WARNORD to units. The order must contain sufficient information for the supporting staff to\nbegin preparation for the training event. This includes items such as the required classes of supply, internal\ntraining that supports the training event, and IPR schedules.\nNote. If Table I is conducted in a decentralized manner, units should provide separate guidance \nand orders.  \n2-62. TADSS training and certification. Units must schedule TADSS operator, installation, troubleshooting,\nand alignment classes, as appropriate. This training is critical for the unit’s success during force-on-force and\nlive-training events.\n2-63. Verify ammunition requirements. Units must update OPORD for class V requirements. Units must or\nshould coordinate class V plan for each range and training event by unit.\n2-64. Verify all ranges, training areas, and facilities. Verification includes any required use of wash rack\nfacilities, weapons zeroing, and hard stand maintenance requirements. If the unit will be establishing an\nammunition holding area, the unit must confirm the appropriate approved location(s) through range\noperations. The MMT may have to deconflict multiuse facilities, external unit requests for the same range or\nfacility, and other issues that negatively affect the TSM or GUNLINE.\n2-65. Confirm synchronization matrix. Once all tasks are verified, unit must confirm the TSM or GUNLINE\nand provide the updated information to the S-3 to incorporate into the live-fire OPORD, as appropriate.\nT-9 – CONDUCT RESOURCE PLANNING AND SUBMIT REQUESTS\n2-66. The focus of T-9 is for units to develop and plan for the appropriate resources to support the training\nevent. This includes all classes of supply, facilities, and external support. (See table 2-5.)\n",

Once the unit reaches T-6, IPRs are\nconducted weekly.\n2-68. Conduct final scenario review. The unit reviews the final scenario developed by the MMT.\n2-69. Publish commander’s intent. The S-3 publishes the commander’s intent for the training event. This\nincludes the focus of the live-fire, use of digital communications, SOP and tactical SOP reviews, simulations\nused in support of the training event, prerequisite training and certifications, and the end state of training.\n2-70. Submit convoy clearances. The battalion or brigade logistics staff officer (S-4) submits any required\nconvoy clearance requests as appropriate for the installation. The S-4 coordinates with the unit’s supporting\ncavalry scouts to conduct a route reconnaissance to ensure the route of march supports any tactical or\nadministrative convoys.\n2-71. Confirm TADSS requests. The MMT must finalize the TADSS plan, including draw, training, issue,\nand turn-in. This includes any vehicles required to support the TADSS installation and use instruction,\ninclement weather areas for training, and any detail support required.\n2-72. Verify scenario approval. The MMT must conduct a follow-up with range operations to ensure the\nrange scenario is approved. Once complete, any additional documents to support the scenarios should be\ncoordinated with range operations, including targetry, thermalization of the target presentations, pyrotechnics\nsupport, and BES use.\n2-73. Request medical support. The MMT must coordinate directly with the unit medical platoon to review\nthe medical support provided on each range. This includes reviewing the status of the certified CLS in the\nunit, ambulance exchange points (AXP), medical evaluation procedures and equipment, strip maps, and\ncommunications requirements. The unit’s medical platoon provides the CASEVAC evaluation procedures\nand supports the call-for MEDEVAC and call-for CASEVAC training requirements during training events,\nas appropriate.\nT-8 – EXECUTE RECONNAISSANCE AND LOCK-IN RESOURCES\n2-74. T-8 tasks focus on range, facility, and training area reconnaissance to ensure units meet the training\nrequirements for the planned event. Units include the entire staff into the reconnaissance effort and physically\nwalk the terrain whenever possible. Units may have to coordinate with other units occupying the ranges or\ntraining areas planned so they do not disrupt other units’ training. (See table 2-6, on page 2-16.)\n",

The MMT or support element draws class IV and V as appropriate to support\nTable III, if conducted separately from the live-fire training event. If the unit conducts Table III as part of the\nlive-fire density, these items are drawn the week before the training event.\n2-104. Conduct Table III. The unit may conduct Table III, Proficiency, in a decentralized manner. Table III\ncan be conducted between T-6 and training execution, provided it is completed before any live-fire event,\nincluding any zeroing.\n2-105. Train convoy operations. Units confirm their tactical SOPs and SOPs during convoy operations\ntraining. This training supports the unit’s driver training program. Units may choose to conduct convoy\noperations rehearsals at the completion of training but it is not required.\n2-106. Proof ranges. The MMT selects a proofing team. This team must include experienced gunners and\nvehicle commanders. The proofing team executes two primary functions—\n\nProvide troubleshooting support during grouping, zeroing, or confirmation at distance (live-fire).\n\nConduct proofing of each scenario on each training range. This includes target visibility,\nthermalization, target height, software target functioning, and BES synchronization.\nT-3 – CONDUCT REHEARSALS\n2-107. The unit executes rehearsals of the training event including back briefs from key leaders and staff.\nUnits should conduct a thorough rehearsal or rock drill of the entire training event to identify potential issues\nas early as possible and provide sufficient reaction time to correct any deficiencies or shortcomings. The\nMMT continues to monitor live-fire prerequisite training and testing, and brief to the commander on the\ncurrent status. (See table 2-11.)\n",

Conduct key leader walk-through. The unit should conduct a key leader walk-through as part of the\nweekly IPR. This walk-through or terrain walk will provide leaders an opportunity to review the training plan\non each range, training area, and facility. Units should pay particular attention to the communications and\ndigital support plan, ammunition issue and turn-in procedures, billeting or bivouac locations, and conduct of\nthe range procedures. The medical platoon should include a back brief to the key leaders detailing all medical\nsupport provided at each training location. This includes training and real-world procedures, such as sick-\ncall procedures, MEDEVAC and CASEVAC plans, ambulance exchange point, and other medical tasks.\n2-109. Confirm rosters and certification requirements. The unit must confirm the manning rosters and that\nall prerequisites have been met for all firing elements. Without appropriate personnel management and\ncertifications, the unit significantly reduces its effectiveness and qualification status, increases the resource\ndemands, and fails to meet training readiness and proficiency goals.\n2-110. Identify firefighting and target details. The MMT must identify and brief the cast of range support.\nThis includes identification of the firefighting NCOs, targetry NCO, barrier NCO, and their supporting detail\nrequirements. (The specific members of the details will not be identified until the firing day.) Practice target\nchange-out and range maintenance requirements between day and night phases, as well as between firing\nunits.\n2-111. Brief range OIC / RSO. The MMT briefs the planned and potential RSOs and OICs and provides\nany books and checklists they will need to execute during training. This provides them sufficient time to\nreview their duties and responsibilities, as well as understanding the complexity of the training events they\nare directly supporting.\n2-112. Conduct barrier rehearsal. The barrier NCO and MMT must coordinate for a full rehearsal of the\nbarrier gate and road closure plan. This rehearsal must be coordinated with range operations and must not\nnegatively impact or interfere with units currently training. This rehearsal is critical to ensure\ncommunications connectivity can be established and maintained with all checkpoints. It provides accurate\ntiming of the process to ensure the range is capable of receiving an opening hot time and day and night firing\ntime. The rehearsal includes one or more iterations for the morning closure, as well as one or more for the\nnight closure requirements.\nT-2 – FINALIZE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS\n2-113. Units collect all required administrative documentation for the training event during T-2.

Draw and issue TADSS. The MMT and a supporting detail will sign for, draw, and issue the\nsupporting TADSS, as needed. Units must keep accurate accountability of the TADSS, particularly when\nusing one system on multiple vehicles. The MMT must take the time to provide a method of maintaining\naccountability of the equipment.\n2-117. Brief external evaluators. The MMT conducts a briefing with the external evaluators tasked to\nsupport the live-fire training event. This meeting should include a conduct of the range briefing, AAR\nexpectations, facility equipment that supports the AARs, current training guidelines, and an overview of the\nfiring scenarios day and night. It is important for the MMT to record the contact information of all external\nevaluators, identify the day and night shift NCOICs, and provide range transportation coordination with the\nevaluation team.\n2-118. Finalize training packets. The MMT finalizes all training packets used for the range. This includes\nsufficient blank documents for retraining and all live-fire prerequisite documentation, as needed.\nT-1 – DRAW EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES\n2-119. T-1 focuses on preparing the unit to enter the training period with precombat inspections, precombat\nchecks, convoy briefings, TLP, and conducting support detail requirements. For units that are conducting\nTable III as part of their training event, they draw supporting TADSS and equipment from their training\nsupport center or range operations. (See table 2-13.)\n",

    "page: 87, manual name: iwq\n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n3-1\nChapter 3 \nRange Requirements \nThis chapter discusses the various Army ranges that accommodate individual weapons \ntraining, the specific small arms range requirements, and required capabilities used to \ndevelop effective training events for individual weapons training, qualification, and \nsustainment. It includes detailed discussion on creating and proofing engagements for \nsmall arms training on the various range facilities. It details all additional requirements \nassociated with individual weapons training, qualification, and associated advanced \nskill certifications used on the Army’s family of small arms range facilities. \nDETERMINE RANGE FACILITY \n3-1. The training strategy for each individual weapon provides the primary and alternate range facilities,\nand identifies each target type, range band, and presentation information for all live-fire events. Units must\nidentify the appropriate range or facility that supports the training event for the individual weapon. Units\nmust have a working understanding of the capabilities available on the Army’s standard range facilities to\ndevelop the specific individual weapons skills and capabilities to build Soldier proficiency and lethality.\n3-2. Units must consider several factors to determine the training location for tactical and live-fire training\nevents. Trainers and planners can refine the following questions to identify the scope of the training event\nand identify the best facility to meet the training requirements. Once complete, the unit must conduct a range\nreconnaissance before developing the scenario to ensure the facility meets the intent of training:\n\nWhat weapon systems will be fired and what are the ammunition requirements?\n\nAre thermal, illuminator, or pointers included in the training event?\n\nWhat type of target thermalization is available on the range?\n\nWhat battle effects are required during training?\n\nWhat tables or events will be fired?\n\nWhat is the desired throughput of the range for one training day?\n\nHow many lanes will be firing?\n\nWhat are the weapon systems capabilities, limitations, and restrictions?\n\nWhat is the maximum engagement distance?\n\nDoes the location of moving targets or custom targets influence the order of tasks to be fired?\n\nWhat targets are common to all fired weapons? What targets can be defeated by all ammunition\ntypes and weapons used during the scenarios to maximize the target presentations?\n\nWhat types of AAR capabilities are available on the range?\n3-3. The family of Army ranges provides the training venue for all individual weapons live-fire training.\nEach range provides various capabilities based on the training focus of the facility. Planners and trainers must\nbe familiar with the composition of each range type, their capabilities, intended use, and the range operations\ncontrol area facilities associated with each. TC 25-8 provides detailed information on the Army’s family of\nranges and their capabilities.\n3-4. Installation facilities vary and the ranges may be named differently than the range types discussed here.\nFacilities with specific honorary names are identified by a range type. Installations have a variety of\nsupporting range facilities for small arms training, qualification, or certification but not all installations have\nall types of facilities or may not have the desired facility type available. Planners and trainers must be familiar\nwith range facility complexes on their supporting installations, availability, accessibility, and capability.\n",
    "page: 88, manual name: iwq\nChapter 3 \n3-2\nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \nPlanners and trainers should plan to use alternate facilities as required to reach their training goals and \nobjectives.  \n3-5. Primary range facilities are designed specifically to meet primary training requirements. Alternate range\nfacilities allow units to train alternate tasks, although they may not be specifically designed to do so. Some\nalternate facilities may require modification to conduct the training and will require support from range\noperations with additional targetry, scenario development and safety plans, or additional equipment.\n3-6. Table 3-1 shows the primary and alternate range facilities for each individual weapons type and the\ntraining strategy through weapons qualification. Although the primary and alternate facilities are capable of\nsupporting the training events, the trainer must review the supporting installation’s facility capabilities to\nensure the appropriate range is scheduled.\nTable 3-1.

All targetry is fully automated, and the event-specific target scenario is\ncomputer-driven and scored from the range control tower. The range operating system is fully capable of\nproviding immediate performance feedback to the Soldier.\nTARGETRY, INSTRUMENTATION, AND ACCESSORIES \n3-17. Individual weapons training programs require specific targets, lifting mechanisms, and capabilities.\nThis equipment is generally termed “targetry,” and must be available on the training facility to meet the\ntraining requirements. All targets must be provided according to TC 25-8. This includes the physical\ndimensions of the targets, their capabilities and performance parameters, as well as the thermal signatures of\nthose targets, for both day and night engagements.\n3-18. There are several types of target mechanisms and configurations used in the individual weapons\ntraining events. Each of these target mechanisms provides a specific capability to the range facility to meet\nthe training and qualification requirements, respectively. These target mechanism types are—\n\nStationary Infantry target (known as SIT). The SIT is placed in a protective emplacement and must\nbe reconfigurable and portable. It is controlled by the range operations center (known as ROC) or\ntower facility using standard range operations software. The SIT targets are typically located in\n“clusters” of six with one moving Infantry target (known as MIT) as described below. They can\nbe operated as a cluster or individually based on the needs of the training scenario. This device is\nbattery-operated and controlled by, radio frequency (RF) or wireless fidelity (known as WiFi). It\nis capable of lifting any E-type or F-type silhouette, as well as extended E-type silhouettes that are\n50 inches tall.\n\nDouble target arm (known as DTA). The double target arm emplacement contains one stationary\nInfantry target lifting mechanism with a bar attachment to lift two E-type or similar targets. The\nSIT is placed in a protective emplacement and must be reconfigurable / portable. It is controlled\n",
    "page: 91, manual name: iwq\nRange Requirements \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n3-5\nby the ROC or tower facility using standard range operations software. They can be operated as a \ncluster or individually, based on the needs of the training scenario. This device is battery-operated \nand controlled by RF or WiFi. It is capable of lifting any two tandem E-type or F-type silhouette, \nas well as extended E-type silhouettes that are 50 inches tall. \n\nWidened stationary Infantry target (known as WSIT). The widened stationary Infantry target\nemplacement is designed to support two stationary Infantry target mechanisms, each capable of\npresenting one E-, F-, or 3-dimensional (known as 3D) type target. The two SIT mechanisms are\nplaced in a protective emplacement and must be reconfigurable and portable. They are\nindependently controlled by the ROC or tower facility using standard range operations software.\nThey can be operated as a cluster or individually based on the needs of the training scenario. This\ndevice is battery operated and controlled by RF or WiFi. It is capable of lifting any E-type or\nF-type silhouette, as well as extended E-type silhouettes that are 50 inches tall.\n\nMoving Infantry target (known as MIT). The MIT is placed in a protective emplacement that may\nor may not be portable or reconfigurable. The MIT can operate at varying speeds from 1 to 11\nmiles per hour (mph) and in varying direction. They are typically positioned within a cluster with\nsix SIT emplacements. These targets in can be operated individually or as part of a larger threat\ncluster or squad. The MIT can include a 15-meter or 40-meter track length, depending on the\ntraining facility. Targets can move in either direction on the track, and are controlled by the range\noperating software in the tower or ROC.\n\nStationary Armor target (known as SAT). The SAT is placed in a protective emplacement and\nmust be reconfigurable and portable. It is controlled by the ROC or tower facility using standard\nrange operations software. Targets for the SAT lifting mechanisms are defined in TC 25-8 and are\ntypically manufactured locally. This provides the training unit with a variety of unarmored, light\narmored, aerial, and armored threats, both in frontal and flank aspects to support the training\nscenario. This device is battery-operated or controlled by RF or WiFi.\n\nMoving Armor target (known as MAT). The MAT is placed in a protective emplacement. It is\ncontrolled by the ROC or tower facility using standard range operations software. Targets for the\nMAT lifting mechanisms are defined in TC 25-8, and are typically manufactured locally. This\nprovides the training unit with a variety of unarmored, light armored, aerial, and armored threats\nin flank aspects to support the training scenario. This device is battery operated or controlled by\nRF or WiFi. The MAT can operate at varying speeds from 1 to 18 mph in varying directions. It\nmay perform as an evasive target where it may change speed and direction based on the scenario.\nThe standard track length for the MAT is 350 meters to provide a full 50-second exposure during\npresentation and travel at maximum speed to the firer.\n\nTrackless moving target, Infantry (known as TMT-I). The TMT-I is a portable, autonomous\nsystem that is controlled by the tower software. It relies on global positioning system (GPS)\nmapping of the training facility to execute training tasks as an opposing force. The TMT-I can\noperate at varying speeds from 1 to 11 mph and must be able to traverse up to a 5 degree slope.\nThe TMT-I is independent of any emplacement and is designed with ballistic protection up to .300\nwin mag. This device supports standard Infantry mechanisms, human type targets, and KD lifting\nmechanisms. It can support standard equipment, such as LOMAH, BES, hostile fire simulators\n(known as HFS), and sound effects simulators (known as SES). Targets can move along a\npredetermined path, move to a series of GPS positions, and react to contact in a tactical and\nunpredictable manner. The targets are controlled by the range operating software in the tower or\nROC individually or as a series of targets to provide high value target discrimination training,\nbased on the scenario.\n\nTrackless moving target, vehicle (known as TMT-V). The TMT-V is a portable, autonomous\nsystem that is controlled by the tower software. It relies on GPS mapping of the training facility\nto execute training tasks as an opposing force. The TMT-V can operate at varying speeds from 1\nto 28 mph and must be able to traverse a 5 degree slope and varying terrain conditions. The TMT-V\nis independent of any emplacement and is designed with ballistic protection up to .300 win mag.\nThis device supports 3D targets with the ability to identify specific hit areas (engine, driver, and\ngunner) on the vehicle, simulate the power-train failure after sufficient ballistic strikes, as well as\nnonlethal strikes. These mechanisms include the ability to support a minimum of two SIT\nmechanisms to replicate the personnel in the vehicle. It can support up to four power and interface\n",

The TMT-V \ncan move along a predetermined path, a memorized path, move to a series of GPS positions, and \nhas the ability to react to contact in a tactical and unpredictable manner. The targets are controlled \nby the range operating software in the tower or ROC, individually or as a series of targets, to \nprovide scenario-based high-value target discrimination training. \n\nKD lifting mechanism. This target supports the lifting capability for a standard 72 inch by 72 inch\nKD paper target (K-type target). It has the ability to support personnel at the target location to\napply hit markers. KD targets must have the ability to integrate LOMAH systems to provide\nreal-time feedback to the shooter and trainer stations.\n\nIron maiden target (known as I-type). The I-type target is a portable system made from body armor\nsteel that provides an individual combatant threat silhouette. The silhouette provides downrange\nfeedback when struck in a spinning or rotating fashion. The force of the firing projectile (up to\n.300 win mag) provides the energy required to rotate or spin the silhouette. The I-type will provide\na separate lethal zone downrange feedback area on the silhouette to provide additional training\ncapabilities. The I-type portable target must require no more than a two-man lift to emplace and\nrecover. This target is not capable of any electronic or software control and has no power\nrequirement. Thermal signatures are provided only through no-power thermal paper or similar\nequipment.\n3-19. Most target mechanisms can support multiple instrumentation or accessories (termed instrumentation).\nThis instrumentation provides training capabilities to the range facility to meet the specific training\nrequirements for individual weapons. The Army-standard emplacement for the SIT, SAT, MIT, and MAT\nlisted above include integration for various accessories when the emplacement is constructed with the range.\nWhen the targetry is portable or autonomous, accessories must be provided either as a stand-alone portable\ndevice or with the ability to piggy-back off of the target equipment.\n3-20. The following is a list of target instrumentation or accessories required for individual weapons training,\nqualification, or certifications—\n\nBattle effects simulator. These devices provide the firer an indication that the threat is present and\nhas fired an armor-defeating munition. This device can be programmed to execute independently\nor timed based on actions from a target mechanism or other instrumentation.\n\nSound effects simulator. These devices provide prerecorded audio that specifically support the\nscenario. The SES maintains a catalog of at least 50 on-demand audio recordings. These\nrecordings can be played on demand from the range operating software, programmed situation\ninstances, or timed scenario events.\n\nHostile fire simulator. These devices provide a simulated small arms fire cues to the shooter. They\ncan be controlled for execution from the range operating system at varying instances for single or\nmultiple rates of fire as the scenario requires.\n\nLocation of miss and hit (LOMAH). This system can be applied to any target lifting mechanism\nto identify the relative location of direct fire impact on a target or the surrounding area. The system\nis capable of identifying small arms projectiles that pass through or within 72 inches of a target.\nThe system is accurate to within 5 millimeters of the actual location (tolerance) for projectiles\ntravelling supersonic. The system cannot identify subsonic ballistic strikes. The x and y location\nof all projectiles passing the z axis of the target will be provided to the range operating software\nand subsequently to a display for the specific shooter / trainer / spotter. The ballistic strike\ninformation must transmit via wireless means as the primary method and hardwire / fiber optic\nmeans for redundancy for fixed emplacements.\n\nHit sensors. Each target must be able to register ballistic strikes by the appropriate caliber. These\nsensors must be placed on the target and tied to the target lifting mechanism for evaluation and\nscoring purposes. Each lifting mechanism must have the ability to select the number of ballistic\nstrikes in the event the scenario requires multiple strikes to defeat the threat or if the threat requires\nballistic strikes in a lethal area.\n\nThermalization. Targets must be thermal capable to facilitate training using day, infrared, and\nthermal optics. Thermalization must follow the shapes and outlines described in TC 25-8 for the\nrespective target silhouette.\n",

Target visibility. All targets must be 90-percent visible from the firing position for the entire exposure \ntime. For engagements that require the forward, lateral, or rearward movement of the firer, all targets must \nbe 90-percent visible for 90-percent of the length of the movement. For example, if the target is presented \nfor 50 seconds in the scenario, the target must be clearly 90-percent visible to the firer for a minimum of \n45 seconds. \n3-31. Target exposure. Target exposure is based on the firing task during the training event. Each type of \nevent will specifically identify the amount of time the target must be exposed, as well as the time allowed for \nthe shooter to engage and defeat the threat presented. The exposure requirements are programmed into the \nrange operating software and are executed during the scenario automatically. Target exposure time begins \nwhen all targets for the engagement are fully presented and locked in the exposed position.  \n3-32. Using moving targets require scenario developers to pay particular attention to how the moving target \nsystem is used during the engagement. The following is a list of actions developers must consider when using \nmoving targetry during scenario development: \n \nDetermine length of track in meters. (Standard is 350 meters in length.) \n \nEstablish a required speed of mover, direction, and evasive characteristics. \n \nIdentify the distance to reach full speed and lock in meters. (This varies on different range \nfacilities.) \n \nDetermine maximum speed in kilometer per hour or mph. \n \nEnsure the moving target exposure time is for 16 seconds after locking and reaching set speed \nconditions. Ensure there is sufficient remaining track at the end of the presentation to slow and \nstop the moving target carriage. Typically, planners should include eight seconds for the moving \n",

Depending on the range operating \nsoftware, this may or may not be taken into account when the scenario is generated. \n\nDetermine the start and end point of the presentation. The scenario may require specific start\nlocations for each lane in the scenario which may require additional time between engagements to\nreset.\n\nMITs may require direction changes to maintain movement throughout the desired exposure time\nfor the engagement.\n\nWhen using trackless moving targets–Infantry (known as TMT-I) or trackless moving\ntargets-vehicle (known as TMT-V) mechanisms, the developer must map out the desired actions\nof the moving target. This may include random or deliberate reactive tactical maneuver of the\ntarget based on a direct fire engagement from the firer. Sufficient space for the systems to function\nas desired after contact must be coordinated and programmed.\nFRIENDLY AND NEUTRAL PRESENTATIONS \n3-33. Friendly and neutral presentations may be included during select training events. These presentations\nprovide the ability to execute target discrimination and classification as friend, foe, or neutral. Personnel\n(troops) or vehicle presentations may be used.\n3-34. Target discrimination and classification training tasks are executed during individual weapons live-fire\nevents during advanced skills training events included in various individual weapon certifications.\nPresentations during live-fire events must provide recognition of combat vehicles-compliant imagery to\nprovide infrared and thermal signatures that most realistically replicate actual threats.\n3-35. During certifications, units may be required to include operational environment elements. Training\ndevelopers must consider the day, infrared, and thermal characteristics that provide the ability to discriminate\nthe threat from friendly, neutral, or noncombatants, reinforcing the established ROE, operational\nenvironment, escalation of force, and other complex decision-making training.\nSCENARIO PRESENTATIONS \n3-36. Targetry may be capable of being engaged and destroyed by an individual weapon but may be subject\nto range limitations. The unit must consult local SOPs and installation range operations when planning\nscenario.\n3-37. Some engagements will require the unit to select which target(s) will be presented during the scenarios.\nUnits and trainers must ensure that the weapon and ammunition has the ability to defeat the target they select.\nUnits can refer to figure 3-1 to determine the appropriate targetry for the weapons or systems during their\ntraining events.\n",

If it is not available, units should \ncoordinate for use of a similar structure on a multipurpose (maneuver) range. Some firing events can be \nexecuted from elevated tower balconies or on locally manufactured room structures. \nTACTICAL STALKING LANES \n3-44. The tactical stalking lane is a training area that is adjacent to the firing range. The stalking lane may \nconsist of multiple training areas or nondudded range area that permits the sniper or sniper team freedom of \nmaneuver to a directed firing position or point.  \n3-45. An individual stalking lane for a single sniper is a 2,500 meters in length with varying widths to provide \ntactical stalking options to the sniper, sniper team, or commander, based on the scenario and OPORD. Units \nshould plan for a 500-meter lane width to allow for lateral movement options to the training unit. Installations \nmay make stalking routes that include changes in direction, hazards, and other obstacles.  \n3-46. Firing points may be included along the length of the stalking lane, although typically found only at \nthe end of the stalking lane. Firing points along the stalking lane must be defined clearly to accurately \ndetermine authorized ammunition and targets that can be safely engaged. Units must plot surface danger \nzones during the training development process, as required. \n3-47. Stalking lanes consist of several key components. These components facilitate all actions of the sniper, \nsniper team, and tower operations to effectively and safely execute the stalking exercise. These components \nare─ \n \nAssembly Area. The assembly area for a stalking lane is the point where the sniper or sniper team \nreceives their OPORD for the mission. The mission brief or OPORD must include all the way \npoints used along the stalking lane as well as the grid location to any firing point and suspected \ntarget or engagement area. \n \nStart point. This is a known point in the stalking lane that initiates the timed stalking event.  \n \nLine of departure. The line in the stalking lane is where the timed mission begins. \n \nLine of contact. This is an expected area where contact with a hostile force is possible. Teams are \nexpected to move tactically from this line forward to the directed firing point(s). \n \nWay point or checkpoint. These are locations where the sniper or sniper team must execute a \nchange in direction, action, or situation report. Movement between way points may be timed for \nevaluation purposes.  \n \nFiring point. This is the area that allows for safe direct fire engagement of the presented target \narray. Each lane must have a minimum of two firing points that provide maximum engagement \npossibilities out to 2,000 meters. \n \nRally point. This is a location identified either in the OPORD or by the sniper team leader during \nthe mission, where the sniper team will regroup, consolidate, and reorganize, as necessary, based \non the tactical situation. \n \nRelease point. This is the point where the vehicle stops all movement and firing. \n3-48. If the stalking event will include a retrograde portion with expected contact, units must coordinate for \na specific range that supports fire and maneuver of the sniper or sniper team. No live fire is authorized in the \nstalking lane except from the identified and approved firing points. \nPROOFING THE RANGE \n3-49. Although small arms ranges operate using standard, preprogrammed scenarios to present the targetry, \nthe range NCOIC still has the responsibility for “proofing” the range. Proofing of the range is the verification \nthat each target is presented correctly to the firer, is exposed for the correct amount of time to the firer, has \nthe appropriate sensitivity to register ballistic hits, and reacts appropriately when the appropriate kill standard \nis achieved. It is imperative this is conducted well before the unit arrives on the range for training. Proofing \nearly provides the unit time and flexibility to make any adjustments to the scenario in coordination with range \noperations personnel, typically the target operator or range officer.  \n",
    "page: 105, manual name: iwq\nRange Requirements \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n3-19 \n3-50. Proofing the scenario, including primary and alternate targetry, is critical for the successful execution \nof the unit’s training event by preventing lost training time due to scenario adjustment. The unit must verify \nthe following elements of the scenario: \n \nDefensive firing position line of sight is available to all targets. \n \nOffensive maneuver box line of sight is available to all targets presented, where required. \n \nTime is available to move from one firing position or posture to the next. \n \nObstructions to the firer that would impede target acquisition, detection, or engagement are not \npresent. \n \nArmy-standard targetry, including thermalization, is provided for all engagements according to \nthe specifications listed in TC 25-8. \n \nFirers can clearly see the appropriate range markers (commonly called range fans) at all firing \nlocations, during all firing actions, day and night, for both offense and defense, as necessary. \n \nUnit times the sequence of events for both day and night scenarios. Night scenarios should be \nproofed during limited visibility. \n \nUnit must check the ready line area and ensure space is available for concurrent training or other \ntraining opportunities. \n3-51. All conditions must be the same as if actually firing, using the same type of weapons that will be fired. \nIf firing a multi-lane scenario, proof all lanes at the same time. Each target should be checked for validity by \nmaking sure it can be viewed through the firer’s optics throughout the entire presentation time. NCOICs \nshould use magnified optics from the firer’s assigned firing position. \n3-52. The range to the targets and the target presentation times should be verified for accuracy and \nconsistency. This includes the time between target presentations. Many individual weapons training events \ninclude a specific time between presentations to reinforce reloading skills under duress.  \n3-53. On computer-controlled ranges, the range NCOIC will proof scenarios and coordinate to adjust target \nlift times, as necessary, to ensure that multiple targets are programmed to lift simultaneously. Adjustments \nmay be necessary for delayed targets to ensure they are presented with the proper lift time and have the \nappropriate target exposure time. \n3-54. A method the range NCOIC can use to ensure target visibility meets the Army standard is to mark each \ntarget with engineer tape or paint at the 90-percent line. For example, a standard E-type silhouette is 40 inches \ntall. The NCOIC can make a visible mark at 36 inches down from the top of the target. When presented, the \nmarking at 36 inches must be clearly visible from the firer’s position (see figure 3-3, on page 3-20.) \n \n \n \n",

When viewed \nfrom the firing position, the target will be a minimum of 36 inches exposed. \nFigure 3-4. Proofing stationary Infantry target example \n3-55. Use the lowest firing position available to the firer (prone) and view the targets through the entire \npresentation. When verifying targets, the MMT should use the thermal sight to ensure the thermalization \ncorrect for both day and night engagements. \n3-56. Figure 3-4 shows a generic proofing of a SIT using a thermal weapons sight. The 90-percent line may \nbe identified with engineer tape, or reverse polarity paper that is appropriately placed on the target. When \nviewing the target, the 90-percent marker should be visible to the firer.  \n3-57. The same process is used for stationary, moving, or evasive targets with one additional requirement. \nAll moving and evasive targets must be visible to the 90-percent standard through 90-percent of the time \nexposed. With the target in motion while running the scenario, the target must meet the visibility standard \nfor 90 percent of its exposure. See TC 25-8 for the appropriate thermal signatures. (See figure 3-5.) \n",

The \nindividual weapon’s training strategies require the use of range facilities, complexes, \nand training areas to efficiently reach weapon system proficiency. This chapter focuses \non defining how to leverage live-fire training assets and resources appropriately to \nreach the intended training objectives.  \nThe goal of this chapter is to enhance the trainers’ knowledge of range operations, \neliminate distractions for the training unit, and maximize the effective use of Army \nrange facilities during the execution of live-fire training at the unit level. At a \nminimum, the range OIC, NCOIC, RSO, and NCO training their Soldiers should be \nwell versed on the information provided in this chapter.  \nPLANNING LIVE-FIRE RANGES \n4-1. The training strategy for each weapon, described earlier in this publication, provided general \ninformation used to properly plan and prepare for the training event. This section provides a more descriptive \nprocess for planning small arms ranges. The information provided is not all-inclusive but provides key topics \nfor units to include in their detailed planning process to enable and facilitate a well-executed training event. \nUnits should review table 4-1 and build their tentative plan, update their SOPs, and schedule for key events \nto support the preparation and execution of the training event (see table 4-1, on page 4-2).  \n",

Range operations\norganizations vary depending on the size and capability of each range on each installation, but the\norganization provides the same fundamental functions in support of all training operations. During the\nplanning process, the training planner should coordinate for an overview briefing of the range operations\nrequirements for their installation’s facilities.\n4-3. \nThe range operations branch plans, controls, and supervises weapon firing on the installation. Duties\nof the installation’s range operations include actions to:\n\nDirect and enforce risk management controls pertaining to firing on ranges in coordination with\nthe safety manager.\n\nPlan, schedule, and operate the installation’s ranges and perform organizational maintenance.\n\nPlan, schedule, and supervise use of facilities, training areas (including restricted airspace), and\nsupporting weapons.\n\nDevelop, publish, maintain, and enforce range and training area regulations, SOPs, airspace\nprocedures, and firing bulletins.\n\nRequisition, store, and issue targets, target materials, and equipment.\n\nEnsure that ranges are maintained and capable of meeting training needs according to the Army’s\nintegrated training area management (known as ITAM) program. The ITAM program establishes\nprocedures to achieve optimum, sustainable use of training ranges and lands by implementing a\nuniform land management program.\n\nEnsure compliance with federal environmental laws and regulations on all range and training land\nassets.\n4-4. The range operations officer is responsible for the coordination and safe conduct of range activity for\nall units using range facilities.

Units should, if at all possible, receive the range brief prior to \nconducting range reconnaissance, this allows for better planning and preparation. Range operations should \nprovide a set of local range regulations and policies.  \nINSTALLATION RANGE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES \n4-5. While at range operations, the unit must ensure they receive a current copy of the installation’s range \nSOP. Training and firing activities require effective coordination with range operations and a thorough \nunderstanding of the installation scheduling procedures. Range operations publishes the installation range \nSOPs. These publications establish the policies and procedures for range activities consistent with safety and \nenvironmental regulations and Army policy.  \n4-6. Installations supplement the safety and environmental regulations with SOPs applicable to individual \nfacilities in the installation-training complex. These SOPs should be reviewed for range availability and then \nconfirmed through range operations. The range installation SOPs should, at a minimum, address the \nfollowing: \n \nAccess and egress control.  \n \nControl and coordination of training facilities. \n \nFiring hours, limitation, and restrictions. \n \nLine of sight / safe-to-fire listing for each offensive and defensive firing area to each target location \nby weapon caliber for each range facility. \n \nAAR capabilities, thermal optics, recording capabilities, and classroom or debriefing areas.  \n \nEnvironmental compliance and stewardship requirements and procedures.  \n \nCommunications between firing unit and range operations requirements.  \n \nAccident reporting procedures.  \n \nAmmunition and munitions handling for each training area and range facility.  \n \nMedical support, MEDEVAC landing zone, and AXP.  \n \nSpecial use airspace, restrictions, and procedures.  \n \nRange safety requirements and procedures.  \n \nSevere weather conditions actions and personnel safety.  \n \nLimits of fire. \n \nTarget availability and capability. \n \nThermalization capabilities. \n \nTarget, firefighting, and barrier detail requirements to the unit. \nENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS \n4-7.

The RFMSS is the Army’s standard, integrated system designed to efficiently schedule and manage \nfiring ranges and training areas on active duty, National Guard, and Reserve installations. It provides the \ncapability for authorized unit users to— \n \nElectronically submit requests for range, training area, and simulator reservations.  \n \nView available facilities and schedule them for approval, disapproval, and rescheduling.  \n \nView, identify, or detect scheduling, environmental, and safety conflicts.  \n \nReview collected range-specific information. \n4-9. Units can use RFMSS to request unit training and track the status of those requests once submitted. \nRFMSS supports all major range management processes. RFMSS allows training units to reserve ranges and \ntraining areas as early as 180 days in advance of the desired training start date. \n \n",
    "page: 113, manual name: iwq\nRange Operations \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \n4-5 \n4-10. There are two types of schedulers—the range control scheduler and the unit / customer scheduler. \n \nRange control scheduler. The range control scheduler is the direct interface between the range \nfacility management and operations center and the customer or using units. The range control \nscheduler is responsible for— \n \nGiving final approval for all training requests for range assets (tomorrow forward). \n \nScheduling training area maintenance. \n \nResolving scheduling, safety, and environmental conflicts as they arise. \n \nPublishing the range bulletin. \n \nUnit / customer scheduler. Unit / customer scheduler is the user of the range facilities. The unit / \ncustomer scheduler is responsible for— \n \nSubmitting training requests. \n \nResolving scheduling conflicts as they arise. \n \nApproving requests for subordinate units if chain of command has been set up in RFMSS. \n \nIssuing and approving co-use agreements. \n \nPublishing the range bulletin. \n4-11. Refer to the reference section of this publication for more information about RFMSS, or to download \na digital copy of the scheduling handbook.  \n4-12. Units will use RFMSS to schedule all the range facilities, training areas, and simulation systems based \non the range operations SOP. The unit should schedule and confirm their range requests typically not later \nthan 90-days prior to the planned training. Units must refer to the installation’s range scheduling policy or \nrange SOP for the specific procedures and lock in date requirements.  \nARMY STANDARD RANGE FACILITIES \n4-13. Army training ranges are specifically designed to train individual through combined arms collective \ntasks required by doctrine with range, ammunition, and explosives safety requirements in mind. These \nfacilities offer the primary trainers and commanders live-fire ranges capable of training and qualifying \nSoldiers on instructional, preliminary, basic, intermediate, and advanced skills in both individual and \ncollective training. \n4-14. Understanding the full capabilities, structure, layout, and requirements for each range type is essential \nfor commanders, leaders, planners, and trainers. Without this understanding, commanders, leaders, planners, \nand trainers will find it very difficult to efficiently and effectively plan and execute realistic training that \nmeets their training requirements, goals, and objectives. \n4-15. TC 25-8 provides information regarding all varieties of ranges available to the Army, target types and \ntheir ordering / construction, acceptable target heights, and information about range operations. Units must \nbe familiar with the Army-standard facility composition, capabilities, and limitations to plan training \neffectively. Also, during training on an installation facility that does not meet the Army-standard as listed in \nTC 25-8, commanders must inform their higher headquarters of the shortcomings, deficiencies, or conditions \nof the facilities or training areas they’ve used. Without user reporting and command involvement concerning \nthe state of the facilities, those facilities may not receive the corrective action or attention they require. \n4-16. Table 4-3, on page 4-6, shows the primary range facilities for individual weapons training. Not all \ninstallation facilities provide the same capabilities to the training unit. Units must confirm the available \nfacilities, capabilities, and limitations with their supporting installation’s range operations. \n \n \n",

The commander, S-3, or MMT, as appropriate, conduct a reconnaissance of the ranges they will use to \nsupport their individual weapons training plan. Additionally, the OIC and NCOIC for each range should \npersonally conduct a reconnaissance and coordinate with range operations headquarters approximately eight \nweeks before training. The reconnaissance should provide answers to the following questions: \n \nWhat routes to the ranges or training areas will be used? \n \nWhat is the range throughput capability? These capabilities include the following considerations \n(see table 4-4)— \n \nHow many firers does the unit expect to train? (Total number of firers [F]). \n \nHow many lanes are available? (Number of operational lanes [L]). \n \nWhat is the average time to conduct one complete firing order, day or night phase?

These personnel are required to maintain appropriate certifications or qualifications by Army policy \nor regulation. Units must maintain the required supporting training and certification documentation on the \ntraining facility prior to, during, and at the completion of the training event. The required personnel and their \nspecific responsibilities are— \n \nOIC – One day, one night (see DA PAM 385-63). The OIC is responsible for everything that \noccurs at the training site.  \n \nRSO – One day, one night (see DA PAM 385-63). The RSO is responsible for ensuring the safe \nconduct of the live fire range.   \n \nMedical personnel – Certified with dedicated wheeled transportation and communications \nsystems, day and night (see DA PAM 385-63 and local policy). The medical personnel provide \nimmediate medical care based on their capabilities in direct support of the live-fire event. \nRECOMMENDED PERSONNEL \n4-25. The commander typically assigns other personnel to assist in running the training event, so he can \nsupervise the overall event more effectively. Recommended additional personnel who the commander should \nuse to maximize the quality of training, provide the best use of the range facility, and maximize training \nammunition and other resources. They include: \n \nNCOIC – One day, one night. NCOICs directly support the range OIC in the safe, efficient, and \neffective conduct of the range.  \n \nMMT – One day, one night. MMTs are the commander’s direct fire technical advisor of the \ncapabilities and limitations of all individual weapon systems, optics, thermals, pointers, \nillumination, and ammunition during training and tactical employment?  \n \nLane trainers – Quantity based on the number of firing points. Lane trainers are experienced \nleaders who are qualified on the weapons, systems, optics, and devices used during the training \nevent.  \n \nBriefing NCO – One day and night. Units may rotate several experienced NCOs. They provide \ndetailed training information to unit leaders who are not part of the training audience or select \nvisitors. \n \nRadio-telephone operators (known as RTOs) – One day, and one night. RTOs are typically junior \nSoldiers who have experience with RTO procedures and provide communication system operation \nfor the range facility.  \n \nAmmunition NCO and detail – One day and night, ammunition handler certified. Typically, they \nare responsible for a small ammunition detail to prepare multiple firing orders worth of preset \nmagazines, belted ammunition, or bandoliers. Units generally use Soldiers from later firing orders \nto perform ammunition detail functions. The NCO oversees the ammunition detail and maintains \naccountability, distribution, collection, and reconciliation of the training event’s munitions.  \nAS DIRECTED PERSONNEL  \n4-26. Depending on the range facility, the training event scheduled, the number of Soldiers being trained, \nand environmental conditions, units may be directed to support additional functions. These directed functions \ninclude a lead NCO with a supporting detail of two or more Soldiers. The most common directed personnel \nare— \n \nLane safeties – Multiple experienced leaders, as necessary, who ensure the safe conduct of the \nrange.  \n \nTarget NCO and detail – as directed by the installation’s range SOP or policy. They provide \noversight of target placement, replacement, servicing, and repairs, as needed.  \n \nFirefighting detail – as directed by the installation’s range SOP or policy. Typically, Soldiers are \nidentified personnel in later firing orders who provide firefighting functions, as needed.  \n \nGuard or barrier NCO and detail – These Soldiers secure the range or SDZ boundaries and entry \npoints as required by the supporting installation. \n",

Once the planning phase is complete and the OPORD for the training event is issued, the tasked range\npersonnel must prepare for the training event. For live-fire events, there are several specified and implied\ntasks that must be accomplished to ensure the safe, effective, and efficient execution of the training event.\nThis section highlights some key preparatory tasks.\nREVIEW OFFICER-IN-CHARGE / RANGE SAFETY OFFICER ROSTERS \n4-63. The unit commander and first sergeant should review the current list of certified RSOs and OICs in the\nunit. Units should ensure all staff sergeants and above are certified annually through range operations. For\nunits firing on nontenant installations, the commander or first sergeant must coordinate for range safety\ncertifications on the approved training installation.\n",

This includes any DA Form 581s (or electronic-DA Form 581s) that are\ncreated to support the draw and use of “in-lieu-of” ammunition types for use during high-fire-hazard periods.\nUnits should confirm that personnel have their ammunition handler certifications to ensure sufficient unit\ncoverage on all training facilities, complexes, and areas during the upcoming event.\nRANGE COMMUNICATIONS \n4-65. The installation range officer controls all ranges by wire and radio to obtain clearance to fire weapons,\nreport, coordinate, and call cease-fire. The OIC controls all training activities, including firing, by the best\nmeans available. In all cases, the OIC plans for a backup communications system.\n4-66. The unit develops a communications plan to ensure positive control of the barrier detail at all required\nlocations. The unit must include a communications plan that ensures direct contact and coordination with\ntarget detail NCO, guard / barrier NCO, range NCOIC, AAR facility, and other key leaders.\n4-67. The unit S-6 is expected to establish all communications requirements for the qualification range. This\nincludes detailing all required range frequencies, providing administrative communication support, and\ndigital communications requirements. Units must check with range operations to determine any additional\ncommunications requirements that are not provided by the range facility.\nRANGE WALK \n4-68. Leaders conduct a range walk of the training facility prior to the training event to become familiar with\nthe range’s capabilities, structures, support buildings, and the ROCA. In general, small arms facilities include\na small ROCA. Understanding the small ROCA layout and function enable smooth execution of the training\nevent.

Once on the range, the OIC, RSO, MMT, NCOIC, and RTO (if assigned), will inspect the range\nfacility. The inspection should be conducted with range operations personnel to ensure the facility is in\nacceptable condition prior to the range opening.\n4-73. If the unit has conducted a range reconnaissance during the planning and preparation phase, the range\ninspection should only require 30 minutes. Once the OIC is satisfied with the condition of the range, the OIC\nand RTO establish positive control of the range tower.\nOPENING THE RANGE\n4-74. The OIC contacts the range operations firing desk through the primary means of communication as\ndirected in the range SOP. The OIC reports the range is OPEN, which informs the firing desk the unit is\nprepared to occupy and use the scheduled range facility. The following actions are conducted by the unit\nwhen opening the range facility—\n\nThe OIC—\n\nMoves to the range or training site before the training unit arrives.\n\nChecks communications and ensures backup communications are available.\n\nEnsures range equipment is present and operational.\n\nEnsures barrier sweeps are conducted, if necessary.\n\nConducts safety specific checks with the RSO.\n\nPrepares to open the range with all required training information:\n-- Unit.\n-- Range Number / Identifier (locally established).\n-- Number of Soldiers for training.\n-- Ammunition type for training by Department of Defense identification code (DODIC).\n-- OIC certification date and initials.\n-- RSO certification date and initials.\n-- Ensures red range flag with red beacon are prepared to deploy.\n-- Reports opening of the facility to range control.

If a malfunction occurs, the Soldier must apply immediate action and continue the engagement. If the\nSoldier cannot reduce the malfunction with immediate action, they must safely perform remedial action. If\nthe malfunction cannot be corrected the Soldier informs the lane safety:\n\nOnce the Soldier reduces the malfunction, they continue firing, beginning with the next task.\n\nThe course of fire is not paused to accommodate immediate or remedial actions.\n\nIf the weapon must be replaced or repaired, the OIC may grant a refire.\nNote. When malfunctions occur on the range, the Soldier must perform the appropriate corrective \naction and continue to engage the threats presented. It is critical the Soldier understands the \nimportance of maintaining their weapon, magazines, and other equipment to the highest standard. \nIf a mechanical malfunction occurs during the event, the weapon must be cleared (if possible) and \nturned in to the unit Armorer for verification and potentially a new weapon or equipment. \n4-88. Rationale – rounds remaining for a firer indicates a weapon malfunction or the firer’s failure to engage\nall targets presented. Rounds remaining at the end of the course of fire provide a training opportunity for\nslow-fire, extended range engagements. No credit for targets hit during this slow-fire iteration is authorized.\nThe following terms are defined for clarity:\n\nTargetry or range malfunction – These occur during the course of fire, where the range OIC\nverifies when a target fails to operate as intended, habitually fails to record hits, or is improperly\npresented to the firer due to no fault of the firer.\n\nWeapon malfunction – This is a disruption of the weapon’s cycle of function that can be remedied\nby the firer through the appropriate application of immediate action. When a weapons malfunction\noccurs during the course of fire, the Soldier is required to apply the appropriate immediate action\nand continue the engagements. Sufficient time is available between target presentations to perform\nimmediate action and continue with the course of fire.\n\nNonmission capable (known as NMC) weapon – This is a verified fault of a weapon which,\naccording to the technical manual, deadlines the weapon from further use and requires direct\nsupport or higher maintenance. If a Soldier experiences more than one malfunction, the range OIC\n",
    "page: 155, manual name: iwq\nRange Operations \n04 November 2019 \nTC 3-20.40, C1 \n4-47\n\ndirects inspection of the weapon. If the weapon is found to be NMC for reasons beyond the control\nof the Soldier, they are authorized to refire the entire course of fire.\n\nRefire – This occurs when during the course of fire and through no fault of their own, a firer\nexperiences a target or range malfunction or a weapon malfunction results in a weapon that is\nverified as NMC. In either case, the Soldier will refire the entire course of fire. The Soldier returns\nto the ammunition issue point, turns in unused ammunition for accountability, and is issued the\nammunition authorized for the course of fire. If a full mission-capable (FMC) weapon is required,\nthe Soldier must be provided the opportunity to group, zero, and confirm at distance prior to\nrefiring the event.\n\nAlibi – Target(s) are presented at the end of the course of fire. When any firer has rounds remaining\nat the end of the course of fire, it indicates that the Soldier did not engage all the targets presented.\nThis could occur for a number of reasons. Alibi targets are presented at 250 meters and 300 meters\nfor Soldiers who have rounds remaining at the completion of the course of fire. Any hits or misses\non alibi targets are not included in the results of the course of fire. Alibi fires are solely for\nslow-fire, extended range engagements for the Soldier.\nCLOSING THE RANGE \n4-89. The following personnel are responsible for specific events while closing the range:\n\nThe OIC—\n\nNotifies range operations that firing has ceased.\n\nEnsures the range or training area is cleared according to local regulations and SOPs.\n\nDebriefs unit leadership on the conduct of the range.\n\nThe RSO—\n\nEnsures all weapons are cleared.\n\nAssists the MMT with misfire reporting and handling.\n\nThe Ammunition NCOIC—\n\nEnsures no ammunition is removed from the range by anyone other than authorized personnel.\n\nPrepares residue certificates required by the ammunition supply point (installation\nrequirements).\n\nAccounts for all remaining munitions, dunnage and brass collection requirements.\n\nReports to the OIC once the ammunition issue point or ammunition pad has positive\naccountability of munitions and is closed to the training unit.\n\nThe MMT—\n\nEnsures range scenario, targetry, and training enablers are prepared for any follow-on training\nunit, as appropriate.\n\nCompiles all firing data, roll ups, and reports.\n\nUpdates DA Form 2408-4, as appropriate.\n\nCompiles all qualification records and prepares commander out brief / roll up, based on the\ncommander’s intent and guidance.\n\nEnsures all misfires are reported and handled according to the appropriate regulations,\ntechnical manuals, and local policies and procedures.\n4-90. Table 4-32, on page 4-48, is an example of information that units must provide as the OIC prepares to\ntransition the range facility to a cold status, followed by closing the range for training. The installation range\nSOP will provide a by-line report for units to follow for their range closing procedures.\n",

The assessment phase in this chapter refers to the unit conducting range operations and for the\nheadquarters of the Soldiers trained. Leaders conduct AARs with each firing Soldier during the individual\nweapon training as part of the training audience’s TLP. AARs help Soldiers to identify deficiencies during\nthe training and how the Soldier will correct them. They are also used to reinforce the Soldiers successful\nbehavior.\n4-92. During and after training, commanders review the tasks trained, assess the unit’s training level in\nrespect to the objectives, and obtain lessons learned to improve the training and unit’s proficiency.\nCommanders record these assessments in DTMS for future use in other training events or to include them in\nunit SOPs.\n4-93. Leaders conduct on-site, informal AARs during training, where training occurs to correct deficiencies\nin observed task execution. Trainers objectively measure unit training against published Army standards\n(found in the training and evaluation outlines). Leaders assess training by continuously checking progress\ntoward task achievement or training objectives.\nAFTER ACTION REVIEW \n4-94. An AAR includes a facilitator, event participants, and other observers. It is an event used to analyze\nan organization’s performance, during and at the conclusion of a training event or operation. The goal of an\nAAR is to improve a unit’s future performance. Using the AAR as a structured review process allows training\nparticipants to discover for themselves what happened, why it happened, and how they can perform the task\nbetter.\n4-95. Once training is complete, the unit conducts the initial tasks of recovering from training operations. It\nrepresents the first steps in analyzing training records from the event to develop future training requirements.\nUnits are required to provide their live-fire results in roll up format to the next higher headquarters for review\nand analysis.\nANALYZE TRAINING RESULTS \n4-96. The analysis of the live-fire training event is critical to the unit’s success. It provides detailed analysis\nto the commander about the live-fire results for the unit. The MMT analyzes the engagements and scores to\nidentify possible training gaps and determines potential corrective training to increase the training unit’s\nlethality and skill.\nREVIEW TRAINING AMMUNITION EXPENDITURES \n4-97. During the analysis, the MMT and ammunition NCO must determine the ammunition expended versus\ndrawn, develop a plan for turn-in and reforecast the ammunition, as needed. This analysis is the first step in\n",

The analysis identifies excellence in the unit. The MMT and NCOIC assist the unit leadership to\ndetermine and prepare awards for certifications, qualifications, or exceptional performance, as appropriate.\nThe analysis will indicate exceptional performers to leadership who can recommend these Soldiers for\nattendance at advanced marksmanship courses. The MMT and range OIC prepare the required memorandum,\nletter, roster, or locally devised form for Soldiers receiving basic marksmanship qualification badges and\nassociated bars (or clasps) for the battalion commander’s signature (see AR 600-8-22).\n",

Specific color(s) applied to the projectiles to enable rapid identification of the type \nand primary use of the munition. \n \nTactile markings. Imprinted or stamped markings that permit identification of certain munition \ntypes visually and through touch. \nA-2. The markings, symbols, color codes, and tactile markings that are stenciled, stamped, or painted on \nmunitions or their containers include all the information needed for complete identification. Leaders must be \nfluent deciphering these markings and symbols to ensure the proper munitions are used for the appropriate \ntask, during training and combat. The following sections provide general information on the various \nidentification features of military munitions used in training and combat. Only relevant information to the \nunit, leader, or firer is provided. See the appropriate references listed for additional information on \nammunition identification. \nMARKINGS AND SYMBOLS \nA-3. Packaging and containers for small- and some medium-caliber ammunition are clearly marked with \nstandard North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) symbols identifying the contents of the package by \nNATO compatibility, ammunition type, and packaging information (see figure A-1 through A-3, on pages \nA-2 through A-3.)  \n \n \n",

The lot \nsequence number identifies the “production run” of rounds produced. Typically, there are lots or batches of \n5,000 to 25,000 rounds produced for large caliber ammunition or 100,000 rounds (or more) for small and \nmedium caliber rounds. The number of rounds produced in each batch is established by the manufacturer. \nEach sequence number identifies the batch of ammunition produced based on the previous conditions of the \noverall lot number.

    "page: 179, manual name: iwq\nAmmunition \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \nA-21 \nA-30. Tier 1 munitions include training unique ammunition types. Training unique munitions include those \nused for training, testing, maintenance, and evaluation. These cartridges are not authorized for use in combat \noperations. The munitions include the following: \n \nBlank ammunition.  \n \nFrangible, plastic munitions, and short range munitions do not have a specific color code, although \ntheir packaging may be marked with the NATO frangible symbol. Although not required by \nMIL-STD, most of these munitions have a blue projectile, and are typically referred to as “blue \ntip.”  \n \nShort range training ammunition (known as SRTA).  \n \nDummy, drilled, inert (known as DDI). Used for training and weapons function testing. \n \nMan-marking munitions – Close combat mission capability kit (known as CCMCK).  \nA-31. Due to the nature of these training unique munitions, most do not follow the MIL-STD 709D guidelines \n(see color code exceptions). Figure A-18 shows the general colors and markings for these exempted training \nunique munitions for reference. \n \nFigure A-18. Training unique munitions color identification and packaging markings example \nTIER 2 AMMUNITION COLOR CODING \nA-32. Tier 2 ammunition (20 millimeter and above) is typically marked with color coding on the projectile \nor subprojectile, as well as colored text that represents any filler or explosive compound for a warhead \nsubcomponent. There are two methods of marking Tier 2 ammunition for identification—projectile color and \ncolored letters, markings, or symbols. \n \nProjectile color. Indicates whether a filler or composition is present in the projectile or \nsubprojectile, and the primary use of the round. \n \nLetter, marking, or symbol color. Identifies the type and purpose of a filler, composition, payload, \nor explosive charge used in projectile or subprojectile. (See figure A-19, on page A-22.) \n \n \n",

Figure A-20 shows the basic Tier 2 ammunition color coding standards. Only the most commonly used\nstandard markings are provided for clarity.\nFigure A-20. Tier 2 ammunition color markings example \nAMMUNITION FORECASTING \nA-34. Determining the proper area to execute training and identifying ammunition allocations is critical in\nthe preparation for the weapons training density. Potential training areas need to consider safety needs and\nrequirements as well as training needs.\nA-35. Units need to plan for increased fire hazards on range complexes and facilities during certain seasons.\nWhen doing so, additional planning must include a means to continue live-fire training without tracer\nammunition. The unit planners and trainers develop a plan in coordination with the brigade ammunition\nofficer that includes sufficient ball-only ammunition to support their training. This requires “in-lieu-of”\nammunition requests that include ammunition types that are traditionally not authorized to units in large\nquantities.\n",
    "page: 181, manual name: iwq\nAmmunition \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \nA-23 \nNote. For example, when the installation’s fire hazard increases to “extreme” or “dangerous” due \nto extremely low precipitation, the installation bans the use of pyrotechnics and tracer ammunition. \nThis is done to prevent uncontrollable or uncontainable fires that will damage the facilities, \nendanger the environment, and potentially cause harm off the installation.  \nDelinking tracers from 4:1 mix ammunition is prohibited.  \nWhen this occurs, the unit should execute an ammunition contingency plan to rapidly draw \ncomparable ball ammunition to continue training through the firing restriction. This plan must be \ncoordinated in advance with the installation and all documentation for the ammunition draw \nshould be prepared. \nA-36. DA PAM 350-38 provides a detailed listing of training ammunition resources authorized to units that \nsupport the respective weapon’s training strategy. DA PAM 350-38, commonly referred to as STRAC or \nStandards in Training Commission, is published each fiscal year (FY). It provides the standards for weapons \ntraining proficiency which units must train to and achieve in a given FY.  \nA-37. Planners and trainers determine their training ammunition requirements for their organic assigned \nweapons, weapon systems, and optics using the tables found in this publication. Planners must be aware that \nthe quantities listed in this training circular represent the requirement, and may not match DA PAM 350-38 \nexactly, which represent authorizations. From this information, the training event planner in collaboration \nwith the S-3, determine the annual forecast of ammunition required to meet the training goals and objectives \nof the commander. The planner and the unit ammunition NCO use TAMIS to review, validate, and submit \nunit ammunition requirements and forecast their training ammunition authorizations by month. \nA-38. The Army uses TAMIS to manage training ammunition Army-wide. It provides visibility of all levels \nof ammunition authorizations, expenditures, and monthly forecasts. Units plan their training events using \nTAMIS authorizations and submit their monthly forecasts based upon their requirements. Once verified, \nammunition stocks required for training will be shipped to the installation within 90 days of the training \nmonth.   \nA-39. Once issued, ammunition items are recorded as expenditures in TAMIS. At the completion of training, \nunused ammunition will be turned in to the supporting ASP, and the unit’s ammunition account will be \nreconciled. Unit ammunition NCOs or master trainers must ensure any ammunition turned-in is applied to \nfuture forecasts for training. Proper management and coordination of ammunition resources are critical to the \nsuccess of the unit and its live-fire training events.  \nTOTAL AMMUNITION MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM \nA-40. The TAMIS is the Department of the Army system for managing operational, training, and test \nmunitions. TAMIS provides the following: \n \nCalculates training ammunition requirements. \n \nCalculates combat and sustainment load requirements.  \n \nPrepares training and operational load ammunition forecasts.  \n \nEnables the preparation, validation, and routing of electronic requests for ammunition. \n \nCollects ammunition expenditures and prepares reports. \nA-41. TAMIS is sponsored by the Army G-3 / 5 / 7 munitions management office. Users of TAMIS include: \n \nHeadquarters, Department of the Army. \n \nArmy commands (known as ACOMs), Army service component commands (known as ASCCs), \nand Direct Reporting Units (known as DRUs) worldwide. \n \nArmy Reserve, and the Army National Guard. \n \nDepartment of the Navy. \n \nDepartment of the Air Force. \n \nU.S. Marine Corps. \n",
    "page: 182, manual name: iwq\nAppendix A \nA-24 \nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \nA-42. Access to TAMIS accounts requires the user to have common access card (CAC) access; however, \nCAC access is not required to use the training videos on this site. \nTRAINING RESOURCE SHORTFALLS \nA-43. During initial planning it must be determined if the unit’s available ranges and ammunition meet the \nplanning requirements. The master gunner offers solutions to mitigate training resource shortfalls. Some \nexamples include the following: \n \nThe required range may be available at another installation. \n \nAn existing range might be converted to support multiple training requirements. \n \nA simulation, subcaliber training device, or reduced-scale range might satisfy the need. \n \nAn increase in operational hours of available facilities will meet the shortage. \n \nAmmunition authorizations from adjacent units may be transferred to support shortfalls. \n \nCoordination for simulations systems assigned to external units can support increased training \ndemand prior to live-fire execution. \nPLANNING CONSIDERATIONS \nA-44. This section deals primarily with the special considerations of ammunition transportation to and from \na range. The unit ammunition manager must forecast the ammunition requirement for any upcoming ranges, \nand in turn must coordinate for specific lift assets with the unit S-4. Each unit in the BCT has different \nprocedures for requesting transportation of ammunition; however, it is imperative to understand the rules of \nammunition transportation, as well as the lift and transportation capabilities of available assets. \nA-45. The fire symbol that applies to the most hazardous material present is posted on or near all explosives \nlocations. It will be visible from all approach roads. One symbol posted on or near the door end of an \nearth-covered magazine is normally enough. One or more symbols may be needed on other buildings. When \nall munitions in a storage area are covered by one fire symbol, it may be posted at the entry control point. \n \nStorage requirement: Placards are placed on entrances to arms rooms, ammunition storage, or \nissue buildings on range facilities where ammunition is being stored. The appropriate fire division \n24-inch sign must be clearly visible when ammunition is present in the structure.  \n \nTransportation requirement: Vehicles transporting ammunition use the 12-inch placard based on \nthe Hazard Classification, as appropriate. Transportation of ammunition and explosives by \nmilitary vehicles is governed by DA PAM 385-64. All vehicles that are transporting ammunition \nand explosives must have specific hazardous placards emplaced in a conspicuous position.  \nA-46. The fire divisions and hazard classifications for stored and transported munitions use the following \ndefinitions: \n \nFire Division 1, Hazard Class 1.1. Large quantity explosive charges that, when ignited, cause a \nmass detonation of the adjoining ammunition. Items in this division are field artillery bags \npropelling charges, demolitions charges, and TNT (2, 4, 6-Trnitrotoluene explosive). There will \nbe few secondary explosions that will be much smaller than the initial detonation. \n \nFire Division 2, Hazard Class 1.2. Items configured for storage and transportation that do not mass \ndetonate when a single item or package in a stack is ignited fall within this division. Explosions \ninvolving the items result in their burning and exploding progressively with no more than a few at \na time reacting. These reactions will project fragments, firebrands, and unexploded items from the \nexplosion site. Blast effects are limited to the immediate vicinity and are not the primary hazard. \nTypically, main gun ammunition (25mm, 120mm), as well as 40mm with explosive fillers are in \nthis division. \n \n \n",
    "page: 183, manual name: iwq\nAmmunition \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \nA-25 \n \nFire Division 3, Hazard Class 1.3. Includes items that burn vigorously and cannot usually be \nextinguished in emergency situations. Explosions normally are confined to pressure ruptures of \ncontainers and do not produce propagating shock waves or damaging blast overpressure beyond \nthe magazine distance. The spreading about of burning container materials, propellant, or other \nflaming debris may cause a severe hazard of spreading fire. \n \nFire Division 4, Hazard Class 1.4. Present a fire hazard with minimal blast, fragmentation, or toxic \nhazards. Small arms ammunition with no incendiary devices fall in this division. \nA-47. Units should refer to the Defense Ammunition Center website for the Ammunition Book Complete, \ncalled the “Yellow Book,” for a detailed listing of hazard classifications by ammunition DODIC. The link to \nthe Yellow Book is listed in the reference section of this publication. Installation ASP will assist units with \nidentifying the required placards for transportation and storage. \nA-48. Figure A-21, on page A-26, describes the ammunition placards based on fire division and hazard class, \naccording to DOD 6055.9-STD. Included are the associated ordering (NSN) information based on location \nof the placard (building, 24 inch or vehicle, 12 inch, respectively). All placards are designed with orange \nbackgrounds with black lettering.  \n \n \n",

However, care must be taken \nto ensure that when loading a vehicle with ammunition pallets, do not exceed the safe load capacity of the \nvehicle. \nA-51. Periodically, the U.S. Army issues various warnings to units related to ammunition. These notices are \noften good for only one year, but might be renewed until a problem is fixed or the information is included in \nmore permanent publications. These warnings can take several forms: \n \nAmmunition information notices (known as AIN) – deal with all types of ammunition. \n \nNotification of ammunition reclassification – deal with all types of ammunition. \n \nSafety-of-use messages (known as SOUM) – cover a wide range of topics, which may or may not \ncover ammunition-specific issues. These vary in topic, but typically relay critical information on \nthe handling and use of the subject item. \n \nGround precautionary messages (known as GPM) – cover a wide range of topics, which may or \nmay not cover ammunition-specific issues. These messages are specific to cautions during use. \n \nMaintenance advisory messages (known as MAM) – cover a wide range of topics, which may or \nmay not cover ammunition-specific issues but are specific to the maintenance aspects of the \nsubject item. \nA-52. Additional information is available on the Army Knowledge Online (AKO). In AKO, select \nKnowledge Network, and then select Abrams Master Gunner Network. A complete listed of SOUM for \nmunitions is on the Sustainable Range Program website, listed in the references section of this manual.   \nNote. It is the responsibility of the safety officer and ammunition NCO to ensure that ammunition \nis checked for restrictions and suspensions. It is the OIC’s duty to abide by those if any \nrestrictions / suspensions are identified. \nFor further information regarding suspended or restricted ammunition, see the reference section \nof this publication. The Defense Ammunition Center website listed in the reference section \ncontains current information, ARMY NAR (needs assessment report) messages with links for each \nmessage; an introduction link to explain the Yellow Book and entries; and an automated look-up \ndatabase that can be searched by DODIC, lot number, or NSN. \nA-53. When inspecting small arms ammunition (functional lots), the NSN and lot number are on the plywood \nbox. See figure A-22, on page A-28, for a flow chart for procedures for identifying suspended or restricted \nlots of ammunitions.

According to AR 385-10, Army personnel who handle ammunition and explosives (known as AE), \nwhether by military occupational specialty or additional duty, are required to complete AMMO-45-DL \n(Introduction to Ammunition) and AMMO-68-DL (Military Munitions Rule) through the Defense \nAmmunition Center’s website. Both courses are offered online as distance learning courses. AMMO-68-DL \nrequires an annual refresher to remain current. It is also suggested that AE handlers complete the following \ndistance learning courses to better improve their understanding and situational awareness of the hazards \nassociated with AE handling. \n \nAMMO-31-DL (Environmental Considerations for Ammunition Personnel). \n \nAMMO-63-DL (U.S. Army Explosive Safety Familiarization). \n \nAMMO-78-DL (Ammunition Publications). \n \nAMMO-54-DL (Risk Management and Preparation of SOP for AE). \n \nAMMO-99-DL (Application of U.S. Army Explosive Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) \nPrinciples). \n \nAMMO-107-DL (Introduction to Explosive Safety Management for Safety Professionals). \n \nAMMO-112-DL (Ammunition and Explosives Storage Safety). \nA-55. All required and suggested courses outlined in AR 385-10 can be accessed through the Defense \nAmmunition Center’s Training website (see reference section). \nAMMUNITION SAFETY \nA-56. Periodically, the U.S. Army issues various warnings to units related to ammunition. These notices are \noften good for only one year, but might be renewed until a problem is fixed or the information is included in \nmore permanent publications. When inspecting small arms ammunition (functional lots), the NSN and lot \nnumber are on the plywood box. These warnings can take several forms: \n \nAIN and NAR deal with all types of ammunition. An example of an important AIN for units to \nread prior to occupation of live-fire ranges is in the reference section of this publication. \n \nSOUM, GPM, and MAM cover a wide range of topics, which may or may not cover ammunition-\nspecific issues. \nNotes. It is the responsibility of the safety officer and ammunition NCO to ensure that ammunition \nis checked for restrictions and suspensions. It is the OIC’s duty to abide by any restrictions and \nsuspensions that are identified.  \nFor further information regarding suspended or restricted ammunition, see reference section of \nthis publication. The Defense Ammunition Center website listed in the reference section contains \ncurrent information, ARMY NAR messages with links for each message; an introduction link to \nexplain the Yellow Book and entries; and an automated look-up database that can be searched by \nDODIC, lot number, or NSN. \nAMMUNITION ISSUE POINT \nA-57. Ammunition issue points (ammo points) are either hard structures or outdoor sites designated for the \nstorage and issue of ammunition. Ammo points require the unit to designate a certified ammunition handler \nas the ammunition NCO, charged with receiving the ammunition, setting up the ammo point, the safety and \nefficiency of the ammo point, ensuring the correct DODIC and amount of ammunition are issued to firers, \nensuring brass and dunnage from used ammunition is returned and accounted for, tracking consumption of \nammunition, and preparing the ammunition and dunnage for turn in at the conclusion of the training event. \nThe unit should assign an ammunition detail to facilitate efficiency at the ammunition point. \nA-58. Upon occupying and receiving ammunition, the ammunition NCO ensures the hazard division placards \nare clearly visible from all sides of the ammo point, and that they reflect the highest rated ammunition type \npresent. The ammunition NCO then checks the lot numbers against TB 9-1300-385. \n",
    "page: 188, manual name: iwq\nAppendix A \nA-30 \nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \nA-59. Fire and excessive heat are two of the greatest hazards to ammunition. Many ammunition and \nexplosives items are extremely sensitive to heat and react at temperatures substantially lower than those \nrequired to ignite ordinary wood, paper, or fabrics. Even indirect heat generated by a fire could initiate a \nreaction and result in an explosion. Smoking is prohibited within 50 feet of any ammo point. \nA-60. A minimum of two fire extinguishers, both rated as class B and class C, suitable for the hazards \ninvolved are available for immediate use when ammunition is being handled. Extinguishers need not be \npermanently located at the site but must be present during the training event. Each extinguisher is placed in \na conspicuous and readily accessible location. Each fire extinguisher is kept in a full or fully charged, \noperable condition. \nA-61. Distribution of ammunition to personnel occurs only in areas designated for that purpose; for example, \nready lines, firing lines, attack positions, assembly areas, or defilade positions. Blank and live-fire \nammunition is not stored in or issued from the same location at the same time. \nA-62. DA PAM 385-63 states: The quantity of ammunition unpacked for training will be kept to the minimum \nquantity needed for live-fire training or an exercise. Packaging material, propelling increments, and fuses \nwill be retained until completion of the live-fire portion of the training or exercise. Units will not burn wooden \ncontainers or indiscriminately use or dispose of ammunition to preclude its return to a storage facility. All \nammunition, unpacked for use but not used, will be repackaged into its original packing configuration prior \nto return to the ASP. \nA-63. To the maximum extent possible, using units ensure ammunition remains in its original packing or, \nupon being opened, is repacked per appropriate drawings or specifications, preferably using its original \npackaging material. This practice is critical to both safety and quality. Ammunition that has misfired or has \nbeen classified as unserviceable must be indelibly marked (preferably using DD Form 1575 [Suspended Tag \n– Materiel]) and segregated from serviceable ammunition. \nA-64. The ammunition is stacked by L number in stacks and arranged so that air may circulate freely beneath \nand throughout the stack. When multiple lots are stored, all items or containers of a single lot should be stored \ntogether and the line of separation between lots must be clearly indicated with a DA Form 3020–R (Magazine \nData Card), equivalent marking, or physical separation. Lots of ammunition must never be mixed randomly. \nThe bottom layer should be raised from the floor about three inches. \nA-65. Empty containers, excess dunnage, or tools should be permitted to remain at the ammo point only \nduring the period of time required to complete the job for which they are being used. No oily rags, paint, and \nother flammable materials are present at the ammo point.  \nUNEXPLODED EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE HAZARDS \nA-66. All soldiers must be able to recognize and react to unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) hazards. \nReactions include avoiding the hazard if possible, securing and marking the site, and reporting the hazard \nthrough the chain of command. Under no circumstances should untrained Soldiers approach, disturb, touch, \nor pick up UXOs, regardless of whether the ordnance is identified as U.S. or enemy. This rule is applicable \nduring peacetime, contingency operations, and in war. \nA-67. Reporting UXOs on the battlefield requires timely and accurate information. According to ATP 4-32 \nthe UXO 9-line report format is— \n \nLine 1: Date/Time group discovered. \n \nLine 2: Reporting activity and location (grid). \n \nLine 3: Contact method: radio frequency and call sign or telephone number. \n \nLine 4: Type of munition (dropped, placed, projected, or thrown). \n \nLine 5: Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear contamination. \n \nLine 6: Resources threatened. \n \nLine 7: Impact on mission. \n \nLine 8: Protective measures taken. \n \nLine 9: Recommended priority (immediate, indirect, minor, or no threat). \n \n",

    "page: 213, manual name: iwq\n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \nC-1\nAppendix C \nWeapons Safety \nThis appendix describes safe weapons handling, the rules of firearms safety, WSS, and \nweapon control measures. Each weapons safety topic is directly related to the \nexecution of training and tactical employment. It is the leaders’ responsibility to instill \nweapons safety responsibility and accountability in their Soldier’s use, care, and \nemployment of their assigned weapons.  \nTo conduct ranges safely and efficiently, while simultaneously ingraining respect for \nthe weapon and its inherent role in the Army, leaders must instruct, educate, and \nreinforce weapons safety routinely. Each Soldier must understand how to apply the \nsafe weapons handling practices as they pertain to a Soldier’s weapon. This includes a \ncomprehensive understanding of the unit’s established ROE, as well as the ethical \nemployment of arms. \nWEAPONS SAFETY \nC-1. All weapons inherently injure, maim, or kill indiscriminately. It is imperative that Soldiers are aware\nof the importance of safe weapons / munitions handling.\nSAFE WEAPONS HANDLING \nC-2. Safe weapons handling procedures offer a standardized method for Soldiers to handle, operate, and\nemploy the weapon safely and effectively. Weapons handling is built on three components—the Soldier, the\nweapon, and the environment described below:\n\nThe Soldier must maintain situational understanding of friendly forces, the status of the weapon,\nand the environment to handle the weapon properly. The smart, adaptive, and disciplined Soldier\nis the primary safety mechanism for all weapons under their control.\n\nThe weapon is the primary tool the Soldier uses to defeat threats in combat. The Soldier must\nknow how to operate the mechanical safeties built into the weapons they employ, as well as the\nprinciples of operation.\n\nThe environment is the Soldier’s surroundings and mindset. The Soldier must be aware of muzzle\ndiscipline, the nature of the target, and what is behind the target. Threats commonly mix with\nnoncombatants, so the Soldier needs to be able to tell the difference quickly.\nC-3. Soldiers must be cognitively aware of three distinct weapons handling measures to handle weapons\nsafely and effectively. The weapons handling measures are:\n\nRules of firearms safety.\n\nWeapon safety status.\n\nWeapons control status.\nRULES OF FIREARMS SAFETY \nC-4. The rules of firearms safety are standardized for any weapon a Soldier may employ or handle. Soldiers\nmust adhere to these precepts during training and combat operations, regardless of the type of ammunition\nthey are using.\n",
    "page: 214, manual name: iwq\nAppendix C \nC-2 \nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \nRULE 1: TREAT EVERY WEAPON AS IF IT WERE LOADED \nC-5. Soldiers must treat every weapon they handle as if it is loaded and prepared to fire. Whether or not a \nweapon is loaded should not affect how a Soldier handles the weapon in any instance. Soldiers must take the \nappropriate actions to ensure they apply the proper weapon status during operations, whether in combat or \ntraining. \nRULE 2: NEVER POINT THE WEAPON AT ANYTHING YOU DO NOT INTEND TO SHOOT \nC-6. Soldiers must be aware of the orientation of their weapon’s muzzle and the path of the projectile if the \nweapon fires. Soldiers must ensure the path between the muzzle and target is clear of friendly forces, \nnoncombatants, or anything the Soldier does not want to strike. \nC-7. When this is unavoidable, the Soldier must minimize the amount of time the muzzle is oriented toward \npeople or objects they do not intend to shoot while simultaneously applying the other three rules of firearms \nsafety. \nRULE 3: KEEP FINGER STRAIGHT AND OFF THE TRIGGER UNTIL READY TO FIRE \nC-8. Soldiers must not place their finger on the trigger unless they intend to fire the weapon. The Soldier is \nthe most important safety feature on any weapon. Soldiers must not solely rely upon mechanical safeties for \nsafe operation. Whenever possible, Soldiers should move the weapon to mechanical safe when a target is not \npresent. \nRULE 4: ENSURE POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE TARGET AND ITS SURROUNDINGS \nC-9. The disciplined Soldier can positively identify the target and knows what is in front of and what is \nbeyond it. The Soldier is responsible for all bullets fired from their weapon including the projectile’s final \ndestination. Application of this rule minimizes the possibility of fratricide, collateral damage, or damage to \ninfrastructure or equipment. It also prepares the Soldier for any follow-on shots or bursts that may be required. \nWEAPONS SAFE EMPLOYMENT \nC-10. Leaders and Soldiers are responsible for ensuring the safe handling and employment of their assigned \nweapons and munitions. WSS and weapons control status provide the Soldier and leader with the Army \nstandard for safe employment and handling of weapons and munitions. \nWEAPON SAFETY STATUS \nC-11. WSS is a standard code that uses common colors (green, amber, red, and black) to represent the level \nof safety for a given weapon. Each color represents a specific series of actions that are applied to a weapon \nto place it in a specific level of safety. The colors are used in training and combat to place or maintain a level \nof safety relevant to the current task or action of a Soldier, small unit, or group. The standard color code is \napplicable to all weapons; the pistol, M4 / M16 / sniper weapons, and the M249 automatic rifle are described \nin detail below. \nC-12. The WSS ratings are evaluated by the level of safety measures applied to the weapon itself. Table C-1 \ndescribes the general safe condition of the weapon for each WSS, based on the standard color scheme found \nin ADP 1-02. \n \n \n",
    "page: 215, manual name: iwq\nWeapons Safety \n30 July 2019 \nTC 3-20.40 \nC-3 \n \nTable C-1. General safe condition of the weapon for each weapons safety status \n \nC-13. All firers and leaders must be fluent in the general meaning of each WSS, how it pertains to the weapon \nbeing employed, and the responsibilities of the firer to own each shot or burst. The following are the basic \ndefinitions for each WSS: \n \nGreen, Fully safe – the weapon is clear, no ammunition is present (no magazine or belt), the \nchamber is empty, and the weapon is on safe. All weapons have an individual task to “clear \nweapon.” \n \nAmber, Substantially safe – a leader must clear and verify that the weapon’s bolt or slide is \nforward, the chamber is empty, and ammunition is introduced to the weapon. This is an \nadministrative or preparatory WSS. Leaders use amber primarily for mounted weapons and during \ncombat operations when directed to maintain a substantially safe weapon with the ability to rapidly \ntransition and escalate to red or black, based on the situation. \nNote. WSS amber is not used in the live-fire events described in this publication. \n \nRed, Marginally safe – the weapon is on safe, the magazine is locked in the well or the belted \nammunition is on the feed tray with the cover closed. For pistols, rifles, carbines, and sniper \nweapon systems, a round is in the chamber and the bolt is forward in the locked position. For the \nM249AR, the bolt is locked to the rear, with the ammunition on the feed tray with the cover closed.  \n \nBlack, Not safe – indicates when the weapon is fully prepared to fire, the firer has positively \nidentified the target, the weapon is on FIRE, and the firer’s finger is on the trigger, and is in the \nprocess of engaging the threat.   \nC-14. WSS black is used to describe the actions of the firer when in a red status and entering an engagement \nsequence. WSS black describes the clear difference between red and actively and deliberately engaging a \nthreat.  \nPISTOL  \nC-15.

    "page: 228, manual name: iwq\nWeapons Safety \nWEAPON CONTROL STATUS \nC-18. A weapon control status is a tactical method of fire control given by a leader. The weapon control\nstatus incorporates the tactical situation, ROE for the area of operations, and expected or anticipated enemy\ncontact. The weapon control status outlines the target identification conditions under which friendly elements\nmay engage a perceived threat with direct fire.\nC-19. Table C-2 describes the standard weapon control status used in tactical operations, in training and\ncombat. Table C-2 describes when the gunner has authorization to engage a threat target once they have met\nthe threat conditions.\nTable C-2. Weapon control status \nWeapon Control Status \nDefinition \nWeapons hold \nEngage only if engaged or ordered to engage. \nWeapons tight \nEngage only if target is positively identified as enemy. \nWeapons free \nEngage targets not positively identified as friendly. \nC-20. Both a weapon control and a WSS are implemented and available to leaders to prevent fratricide and\nlimit collateral damage. Leaders develop these postures or statuses for a particular area of operations or type\nof mission. Leaders should clearly outline both for all Soldiers, usually in the OPORD, WARNORD, or\nFRAGORD.\nC-16\nTC 3-20.40 \n30 July 2019 \n",

Once \nsuccessfully completed, Soldiers are qualified to progress to higher levels of \nmarksmanship training or certification, and to use the weapon during any future \ncollective live-fire training events within the qualification period.  \nThis appendix provides an overview of the qualification standards. It provides a \nsnapshot to commanders of the Army’s requirement to achieve and sustain a level of \nweapons proficiency for their Soldiers assigned a pistol.

Once all firers have recovered their targets and placed fresh A8 targets on the target frame, firers\ncollect their brass, ammunition, and magazines from their firing positions after which the lane safety clears\nthem. Once complete, the lane safety communicates the WSS to the tower operator and the tower operator\nissues an administrative command moving the Soldiers off the range.\nE-44. The tower operator may direct certain firers to remain on the firing point, as necessary. Those firers\ninclude Soldiers assigned both a BUIS and CCO or RCO, and who still need to zero the second aiming device.\nThose Soldiers require additional ammunition to complete the requisite tasks.\nE-45. During the range reconnaissance, the unit determines if the 25-meter target frame interferes with the\nfirer’s ability to acquire and engage the zero confirmation target. Where the 25-meter target frame presents\na line-of-sight issue to the zero confirmation target, units should bypass the confirmation process. When the\nzero confirmation target cannot be safely or effectively used with the 25-meter target frame emplaced, units\nconduct confirmation at distance (one each, five-round magazine) by—\n\nCompleting all firing orders through grouping and zeroing tasks, then removing the target frames\nfrom the range while in a cold or dry status.\n\nCompleting stage 3 confirmation at distance and stage 4 application of hold-offs prior to\nconducting Table V (when using a separate facility).\nE-46.

Leaders instruct Soldiers on the objectives of the tasks in Table V and the importance of the functional \nelements of the shot process. Table V contains 18 firing tasks with an administrative pause programmed at \nthe end of each phase to facilitate emergency reloading and changing positions.  \nE-65. Soldiers enter the range and move to their firing points. Once at the firing point, firers assume a \nstanding firing position with rifle and carbines in a green status. Firers fire Table V from the ready at varying \nfiring positions throughout the duration of the course of fire, where— \n \nTasks 1 through 5 are fired from the prone, unsupported firing position.  \n \nTasks 6 through 10 are fired from the prone, supported firing position.  \n \nTasks 11 through 14 are fired from the kneeling, supported firing position.  \n \nTasks 15 through 18 are fired from the standing, supported firing position. \nE-66. Firers must hit a minimum of 28 of the 40 targets presented (70 percent) to successfully pass the event. \nIt is not required for Soldiers to complete this table successfully before conducting Table VI tasks. This event \nis purposefully more rigorous than the qualification event where the targets are presented in a rapid tempo, \nand the time to transition between firing positions and tactical reloading are reduced. This practice event \ninduces periodic weapon malfunctions using DDI munitions into the firers’ magazines in a random fashion. \nThe leader annotates the official record of training on DA Form 7801. \nE-67. Soldiers begin Table V training by moving into the firing position following administrative commands \nfrom the tower operator. The tower operator uses administrative commands to control the flow of the range, \nmovement of personnel, and other command and control purposes.

Table VI contains 18 firing tasks with an administrative pause programmed at\nthe end of each phase to facilitate emergency reloading and changing positions.\nE-90. Soldiers enter the range and move to their firing points. Once at the firing point, firers assume a\nstanding firing position with rifle and carbines in a green status. Soldiers fire Table VI tasks from the ready\nat varying firing positions throughout the duration of the course of fires in the following manner:\n\nTasks 1 through 5 are fired from the prone, unsupported firing position.\n\nTasks 6 through 10 are fired from the prone, supported firing position.\n\nTasks 11 through 14 are fired from the kneeling, supported firing position.\n\nTasks 15 through 18 are fired from the standing, supported firing position.\nE-91.

At a minimum, Soldiers are required to fire this course of fire while wearing \nindividual combat equipment and a protective mask with hood. All Soldiers assigned a rifle or carbine must \ncomplete this course of fire as part of their qualification based on their access to primary simulations systems \n(see table E-82). \nTable E-82.

The ALT-C challenges firers with \nsingle stationary targets from the standing, kneeling, and prone firing positions within the effective range of \nthe weapon. Table E-89 outlines the tasks, conditions, and standards for the conduct of rifle and carbine \nvalidation. \n \nTable E-89. Rifle and Carbine Validation, task, conditions, and standard \nTask: \nValidate Soldier’s safe use of the M16 rifle or M4 carbine by demonstrating rudimentary \nengagement skills.  \nConditions: \nGiven the following: \n Fully mission capable weapon, as assigned on the master authorization list for the \nunit. \n Full combat uniform, issued equipment, and protective mask. \n Authorized range facility and approved targetry. \n Authorized ammunition. \nStandard: \nFor firers to receive a GO validating their existing qualification, they must: \n Place 75-percent (three of four) rounds in the six minutes of angle circle on each \nindividual silhouette during the basic slow fire phase in the time allotted.   \n Place 75-percent (three of four) rounds in each individual silhouette during the \nintermediate, rapid fire phase in the time allotted. \nFailure to achieve either standard during the basic or intermediate phase condemns the \nfirer’s existing qualification. \nE-136.

Leaders instruct Soldiers on the objectives of rifle and carbine validation, and the importance of the \nfunctional elements of the shot process. Validation is conducted in two phases—basic slow fire and \nintermediate rapid fire. Within those phases, firers engage 10 silhouettes from four different firing \npositions—prone unsupported, prone supported, kneeling supported, and standing supported.  \nE-147. Firers must achieve 75 percent (3 of 4) hits within the 4-centimeter circle on each silhouette during \nthe slow fire phase, and 75 percent (3 of 4) on each silhouette during the rapid fire phase to earn a GO. The \nGO indicates the firer validated their existing qualification successfully, and extends their existing QD by six \nmonths.  \nE-148. Soldiers begin ALT-C by moving into the firing position following administrative commands from \nthe tower operator Administrative commands control the flow of the range, movement of personnel, and \nother command and control purposes.

Units conduct Automatic Rifle, Table IV, Basic, which consists of four stages with live ammunition \non an approved range facility. Leaders use Table IV for all firers to evaluate their ability to consistently place \nshot groups in a designated diameter circle on a target at 25 meters, followed by confirming the zero is \nacceptable at true distance and then applying hold-offs at 100 and 200 meters. Units conduct the tasks in this \ntable only after successful completion of the live-fire prerequisite tables (Tables I, II, and III). During home \nstation training, Soldiers must complete Table IV tasks prior to progressing to any other training event. Units \nconduct Table IV tasks on an ARF or other approved facility. \nTASK, CONDITIONS, AND STANDARD \nF-24. Firers conduct Table IV tasks from the prone supported firing position 25 meters from the targets \noutlined in this chapter.

Leaders instruct Soldiers on the objectives of Table V and the importance of the functional elements \nof the shot process. Table V contains 18 firing tasks with an administrative pause programmed at the end of \neach phase to facilitate emergency reloading and changing positions.  \nF-67. Soldiers enter the range and move to their firing points. Once at the firing point, firers assume a \nstanding firing position with automatic rifles in a green status. Firers fire Table V tasks from the ready at \nvarying firing positions throughout the duration of the course of fire, where— \n \nTasks 1 through 5 are fired from the prone, unsupported firing position.  \n \nTasks 6 through 10 are fired from the prone, supported firing position.  \n \nTasks 11 through 14 are fired from the kneeling, supported firing position.  \n \nTasks 15 through 18 are fired from the standing, supported firing position. \nF-68. Firers must hit a minimum of 28 of the 40 targets presented (70 percent) to successfully pass the event. \nSoldiers do not have to complete this table successfully before conducting Table VI training. This event is \npurposefully more rigorous than the qualification event where the targets are presented in a rapid tempo, and \nthe time to transition between firing positions and tactical reloading are reduced. The leader annotates the \nofficial record of training on DA Form 7801. \nF-69. Soldiers begin the Table V task by moving into the firing position with the use of administrative \ncommands from the tower operator. The tower operator uses administrative commands to control the flow of \nthe range, movement of personnel, and other command and control purposes. Table F-39 provides an example \nof the administrative commands for moving a new firing order into position. \n \nTable F-39.

Leaders instruct Soldiers on the objectives of Table VI and the importance of the functional elements \nof the shot process. Table VI contains 18 firing tasks with an administrative pause programmed at the end of \neach phase to facilitate reloading and changing positions.  \nF-92. Soldiers enter the range and move to their firing points. Once at the firing point, firers assume a \nstanding firing position with automatic rifles in a green status. Soldiers fire Table VI tasks from the ready at \nvarying firing positions throughout the duration of the course of fire, where: \n \nTasks 1 through 5 are fired from the prone, unsupported firing position.  \n \nTasks 6 through 10 are fired from the prone, supported firing position.  \n \nTasks 11 through 14 are fired from the kneeling, supported firing position.  \n \nTasks 15 through 18 are fired from the standing, supported firing position. \nF-93. Firers must hit a minimum of 28 of the 40 targets presented (70 percent) to successfully pass this event. \nAll firers must also complete Table VI, Qualification, CBRN and Table VI, Qualification, Night, either in \nsimulation (primary) or during live-fire (when authorized simulator systems are unavailable) as part of their \noverall automatic rifle qualification. The leader annotates the official record of training on DA Form 7801. \nF-94.

Once all snipers are set, the lane safety directs them to the 100-meter target frame to replace all paper \ntargetry. Once the snipers are complete and back to the baseline, they collect their brass, ammunition, \nmagazines, and dunnage from their firing position, after which the lane safety clears them. \nG-57. The tower may direct certain snipers to remain on the firing point, as necessary. This includes snipers \nthat must zero additional aiming devices. Those snipers require additional ammunition to complete the \nadditional tasks.  \nG-58. Once all snipers have been verified green by the lane safety, the tower operator directs the firing order \noff the firing point. The tower operator, spotter, or sniper team leader must identify snipers who have failed \nto achieve the confirmation at distance standard (4 of 5 hits at zeroing distance) and move those snipers to a \npredetermined retraining location.

Table V, Practice, is a practice table leaders use to prepare snipers for the qualification course of fire. \nThe purpose of Table V is to challenge snipers with single stationary and moving targets out to the maximum \neffective range of the sniper weapon system, from various basic and advanced firing positions. Leaders use \n",

In a timed scenario, the sniper experiences and learns target prioritization and weapons manipulation. \nThis event is more rigorous than the qualification event where the targets are presented in a rapid tempo, and \nthe time to transition between firing positions and tactical reloading are reduced.   \nG-63. Table V occurs on a SFF, HSR, MPMG, multipurpose range complex (or similar maneuver range) \n(known as MPRC), or comparable range facility. This course of fire is specifically designed to build the skills \nnecessary to engage and defeat threats or high value targets from various firing conditions, including urban \nenvironments. For installations that do not provide the capabilities required of these engagements, refer to \nthe authorized modification section. \nG-64. Units may include a tactical movement or stalking lane between stages (day fire and night fire, \nassisted) to integrate tactical and live-fire training. Units will need to secure the appropriate training area(s) \nto support the tactical and stalking tasks.  \nTASK, CONDITIONS, AND STANDARD \nG-65. Table G-42 outlines the task, conditions, and standard for the conduct of Table V tasks. The sniper \nconducting the event should know the task, conditions, and standard and should explain them during the \nrange briefing. \n \nTable G-42.

Leaders instruct snipers on the objectives of Table V and the importance of the functional elements of \nthe shot process. Table V, Stage 1, Day Fire, contains 11 firing tasks with an administrative pause \nprogrammed at the end of each engagement to facilitate changing firing positions.  \nG-83. Snipers enter the range and move to their firing points. Once at the firing point, firers assume a prone \nsupported firing position with weapons in a green status. Firers fire Table V tasks from the READY at varying \nfiring positions throughout the course of fire. The sniper teams conduct the course of fire such that— \n \nTask 0, sketch card and cold bore shot, is completed prior to conducting the scored engagements.  \n \nAll engagements in the scored events are fired from positions established by the sniper using \navailable equipment, attachments, or surrounding items. \n \nFirst round hits receive 10 points. \n \nSecond round hits receive 5 points. \n \nNo points are awarded for hits beyond the second round or for targets not hit. \nG-84. Firers must score a minimum of 140 of 200 points (70 percent) on the 10 engagements presented to \nsuccessfully pass this event with a minimum of 70 points in stage 1 and 70 points in stage 2. It is not required \nfor Soldiers to successfully complete this table before conducting Table VI. This event is purposefully more \nrigorous than the qualification event. The targets are presented in a rapid tempo, and the time to transition \nbetween firing positions and tactical reloading are reduced. Leaders annotate the official record of training \non DA Form 7811. \nG-85. Snipers begin Table V by moving into the firing position with the use of administrative commands \nfrom the tower operator. Tower operators use administrative commands to control the flow of the range, \nmovement of personnel, and other command and control purposes. Table G-51 provides an example of the \nadministrative commands for moving a new firing order into position. \n \nTable G-51.

Targets are presented such that 90-percent \nof the target is clearly visible to the sniper from the expected or planned firing position. Targets are exposed \nto the sniper based on the target’s tactical posture presented during the engagement as follows: \n \nStationary target engagements are exposed for 30 seconds. \n \nMoving target engagements are exposed for 35 seconds. \n \nEvasive target engagements are exposed for 40 seconds. \nG-93. The sniper and spotter have three minutes to establish their firing position and report SET to the sniper \nteam leader after each engagement. During the transition period to the next engagement or firing position, \nthe sniper and spotter are responsible to reload as appropriate, update their sketch card, and establish the best \nprone supported firing position overlooking the directed target area.

Leaders instruct snipers on the objectives of Table V, Practice, Stage 2, Night Fire, Assisted, and the \nimportance of the functional elements of the shot process. Table V, Practice, Stage 2, Night Fire, Assisted, \ncontains 11 firing tasks with an administrative pause programmed at the end of each engagement to facilitate \nchanging firing positions.  \nG-96. Snipers enter the range and move to their firing points. Once at the firing point, firers assume a prone \nsupported firing position with weapons in a green status. Firers fire Table V tasks from the ready at varying \nfiring positions throughout the duration of the course of fire. The sniper teams conduct the course of fire such \nthat— \n \nTask 0, sketch card and cold bore shot, is completed prior to conducting the scored engagements.  \n \nAll engagements in the scored events are fired from positions established by the sniper using \navailable equipment, attachments, or surrounding items. \n \nFirst round hits receive 10 points. \n \nSecond round hits receive 5 points. \n \nNo points are awarded for hits beyond the second round or for targets not hit. \nG-97. Firers must score a minimum of 140 of 200 points (70 percent) on the 10 engagements presented to \nsuccessfully pass this event with a minimum of 70 points in stage 1 and 70 points in stage 2. It is not required \nfor Soldiers to successfully complete this table before conducting Table VI. This event is purposefully more \nrigorous than the qualification event where the targets are presented in a rapid tempo, and the time to \ntransition between firing positions and tactical reloading are reduced. Leaders annotate the official record of \ntraining on DA Form 7811. \nG-98. Snipers begin Table V by moving into the firing position following administrative commands from \nthe tower operator.

Leaders instruct snipers on the objectives of Table VI and the importance of the functional elements\nof the shot process. Table VI, Stage 1, Day Fire, contains 11 firing tasks with an administrative pause\nprogrammed at the end of each engagement to facilitate change of firing positions.\nG-123. Snipers enter the range and move to their firing points. Once at the firing point, firers assume a\nprone supported firing position with weapons in a green status. Firers fire Table VI from the ready at varying\nfiring positions throughout the course of fire. The sniper teams conduct the course of fire so that—\n\nTask 0, sketch card and cold bore shot, is completed prior to conducting the scored engagements.\n\nAll engagements in the scored events are fired from positions established by the sniper using\navailable equipment, attachments, or surrounding items.\n\nFirst round hits receive 10 points.\n\nSecond round hits receive 5 points.\n\nNo points are awarded for hits beyond the second round or for targets not hit.\nG-124. Firers must score a minimum of 140 of 200 points (70 percent) on the 10 engagements presented to\nsuccessfully pass this event with a minimum of 70 points in stage 1 and 70 points in stage 2. Leaders annotate\nthe official record of training is annotated on DA Form 7811.\nG-125. Snipers begin Table VI by moving into the firing position following administrative commands from\nthe tower operator. Tower operators use administrative commands to control the flow of the range, movement\nof personnel, and other command and control purposes.

A \nlane safety verifies the clearing prior to the Soldier moving from the firing point. Once the lane safety clears \nall the Soldiers, the lane safety communicates the WSS to the tower operator. The tower operator issues an \nadministrative command to move the completed Soldiers off the range. Table G-102 is an example of this \ncommand.  \n \nTable G-102.

Targets are presented such that 90-percent \nof the target is clearly visible to the sniper from the expected or planned firing position. Targets are exposed \nto the sniper based on the target’s tactical posture presented during the engagement as follows: \n \nStationary target engagements are exposed for 30 seconds. \n \nMoving target engagements are exposed for 45 seconds. \n \nEvasive target engagements are exposed for 60 seconds. \nG-133. The sniper and spotter have three minutes to establish their firing position and report SET to the \nsniper team leader after each engagement. During the transition period to the next engagement or firing \nposition, the sniper and spotter are responsible to reload as appropriate, update their sketch card, and establish \nthe best prone supported firing position overlooking the directed target area.

Leaders instruct snipers on the objectives of Table VI, Qualification, Stage 2, Night Fire, Assisted, \nand the importance of the functional elements of the shot process. Table VI, Qualification, Stage 2, Night \nFire, Assisted contains 11 firing tasks with an administrative pause programmed at the end of each \nengagement to facilitate change of firing positions.  \nG-136. Snipers enter the range and move to their firing points. Once at the firing point, firers assume a \nprone supported firing position with weapons in a green status. Firers fire Table VI from the ready at varying \nfiring positions throughout the duration of the course of fire. The sniper teams will conduct the course of fire \nso that— \n \nTask 0, sketch card and cold bore shot, is completed prior to conducting the scored engagements.  \n \nAll engagements in the scored events are fired from positions established by the sniper using \navailable equipment, attachments, or surrounding items. \n \nFirst round hits receive 10 points. \n \nSecond round hits receive 5 points. \n \nNo points are awarded for hits beyond the second round or for targets not hit. \nG-137. Firers must score a minimum of 140 of 200 points (70 percent) on the ten engagements presented \nto pass this event with a minimum of 70 points in stage 1 and 70 points in stage 2. It is not required for \nSoldiers to complete this table before conducting Table VI. This event is purposefully more rigorous than the \nqualification event where the targets are presented in a rapid tempo, and the time to transition between firing \npositions and tactical reloading are reduced. Leaders annotate the official record of training on \nDA Form 7811. \nG-138. Snipers begin Table VI by moving into the firing position following administrative commands from \nthe tower operator.

Units conduct the tasks in this table\nonly after completing the live-fire prerequisite tables (Tables I, II, and III). During home station training,\nSoldiers must complete Table IV tasks prior to progressing to any other training event. Units conduct\nTable IV tasks on a basic 10 meter or 25 meter firing range (zero) or other approved facility.\nH-24. The purpose of the URM, Table IV, Basic is to introduce Soldiers to the basic movements, aiming\ntechniques, and trigger controls as they relate to URM. Unlike the conduct of fire used previously during rifle\ntraining and qualification, URM uses simplified commands delivered at a moderate or rapid tempo. The\ncommands provided to the Soldier during URM describe the engagement or movement technique.\nInstructions to the firer are followed by two subsequent commands, READY and UP. READY is the\npreparatory command, and UP is the command of execution during this event.\nH-25. All firer’s participating in Table IV must have previously zeroed and qualified the weapon with\nassociated aiming devices. If the firer has made any changes to the weapon or aiming device, the firer must\nconfirm zero at 25 meters prior to executing Table IV.\n",

Urban Rifle Marksmanship, Table V, Practice, is a live-fire event used in preparation for the \ncertification course of fire. Table V purposefully challenges firers with single static targets from the standing, \nunsupported firing position and while moving within close quarters range. Leaders use Table V to train the \nfirer to engage single, stationary, and close quarters targets while applying the functional elements of the shot \nprocess. In a timed scenario, the firer experiences and learns urban marksmanship engagement techniques, \nmovement, and weapons manipulation. Leaders conduct Table V tasks on a basic 10 meter and 25 meter \nfiring range (zero) or other approved facility. Soldiers fire the tasks listed in Table V in the standing position \nor while moving. \nH-58. Unlike the conduct of fire used previously during rifle training and qualification, URM uses simplified \ncommands delivered at a moderate or rapid tempo. The commands provided to the Soldier during URM \ndescribe the engagement or movement technique. Instructions to the firer are followed by two subsequent \ncommands, READY and UP. READY is the preparatory command, and UP is the command of execution \nduring this event. \nH-59. All firer’s participating in Table V must have previously zeroed and qualified the weapon with \nassociated aiming devices and completed URM, Table IV. If the firer has made any changes to the weapon \nor primary optic or aiming device, the firer must confirm zero at 25 meters prior to executing Table V. \nTASK, CONDITIONS, AND STANDARD \nH-60. Table H-35 outlines the task, conditions, and standard for the conduct of Table V. The firer conducting \nthe event should know the task, conditions, and standard and should explain them during the conduct of the \nrange briefing. \n \nTable H-35. Urban rifle marksmanship, Table V, Practice \nTask: \nDemonstrate lethal shot placement proficiency with the M4, M16, or M249 automatic rifle. \nConditions: \nGiven the following: \n Fully mission capable weapon. \n Magazine pouches. \n Magazines. \n Authorized range facility. \n Full-caliber ammunition. \n Approved targetry. \nStandard: \nAchieve 70-percent minimum hits (28 of 40 for M4 / M16 or 35 of 50 for M249 automatic \nrifle) inside the lethal zone on the B-7 target. \n \n \n",

All Soldiers assigned to an MTOE Infantry squad, who participate in a shoot house or other urban\ncollective live-fire event must complete URM, Table VI prior to conducting those events. URM, Table VI,\nCertification is a prerequisite for any shoot house or collective live-fire training event. The purpose of URM,\nTable VI is to certify the Soldier’s proficiency to lethally employ an M4, M16, or M249 automatic rifle\nduring a close-quarters fight prior to conducting high-risk live-fire events in urban or close quarter’s\nenvironments.\nH-93. To effectively plan and forecast for sufficient training ammunition, the unit must refer to the\nammunition requirements listed in table H-55. Units need to identify the total number of firers and should\nplan for unscheduled firers and necessary retraining by increasing their forecasted training ammunition.\nTable H-55.

The detail must also prepare and issue belts of 50-rounds inside the belt\ncontainer per M249 automatic rifle firer. This requires the ammunition detail to reuse M249 belt containers\nfor subsequent firing orders. Leaders issue ammunition during the night iteration in the same method as the\nday.\nH-95. Leaders use Table VI as a timed event. From the command of UP the firers have three seconds to place\na controlled pair or three-round bursts into the lethal zone of the B7 target. Leaders issue two, 10-round\nmagazines (20 rounds total for M4- or M16-series) or one belt container loaded with 50 linked rounds\n(M249AR) to conduct both the day and night phase of Table VI. Table H-56, on page H-58, shows the\nammunition breakdown for URM, Table VI. Firers place ammunition in their ammunition pouches.

These devices, designed for use during periods of limited visibility, \ninclude pointers, illuminators, lasers, and thermal weapons sights. Once successfully \ncompleted, Soldiers can progress to higher levels of marksmanship training or \ncertification. They may use the weapon and associated aiming device during any \nlimited visibility, collective live-fire training events within the certification period.  \nAppendix I provides an overview of the assisted night fire certification standards. This \nappendix provides a snapshot to commanders of the Army’s requirement to achieve \nand sustain a level of weapons proficiency for their Soldiers who are assigned a rifle \nand carbine with a limited visibility-aiming device. Soldiers executing the assisted, \nnight fire training strategy must also be qualified on their primary, assigned individual \nweapon and equipment within the past certification period based on the commander’s \nMAL. \nASSISTED NIGHT FIRE TRAINING STRATEGY \nI-1. The standard IWTS lists six tables of training events. Each table’s events are explained with all\nassociated resources required; ranges, simulators, simulations, ammunition, and time, as appropriate. This\nappendix has a section for each training event and stage within the weapon’s strategy. Companies executing\nthe training events will apply the eight-step training model, as appropriate.\nI-2.

Leaders instruct Soldiers on the objectives of Table V and the importance of the functional elements \nof the shot process. Table V contains 22 firing tasks with an administrative pause programmed at the end of \neach phase to facilitate emergency reloading and changing positions.  \nI-66. Soldiers enter the range and move to their firing points. Once at the firing point, firers assume a \nstanding firing position with rifle and carbines in a green status. Soldiers fire Table V tasks from the ready \nat varying firing positions throughout the duration of the course of fire, where— \n \nTasks 1 through 5 are fired from the prone, unsupported firing position.  \n \nTasks 6 through 10 are fired from the prone, supported firing position.  \n \nTasks 11 through 14 are fired from the kneeling, supported firing position.  \n \nTasks 15 through 18 are fired from the standing, supported firing position. \n \nTasks 19 through 22 are fired from the standing, supported firing position in a simulated chemical \nenvironment. \nI-67. Firers must hit a minimum of 35 of the 50 targets presented (70 percent) to successfully pass this event. \nSoldiers are not required to successfully complete Table V tasks before conducting Table VI. This event is \npurposefully more rigorous than the certification event where the targets are presented in a rapid tempo, and \nthe time to transition between firing positions and tactical reloading are reduced. The leader annotates the \nofficial record of training on DA Form 7489. \nI-68. Soldiers begin Table V tasks by moving into the firing position following administrative commands \nfrom the tower operator. Tower operators use administrative commands to control the flow of the range, \nmovement of personnel, and other command and control purposes. Table I-39 provides an example of the \nadministrative commands for moving a new firing order into position. \n \nTable I-39.

Firers must hit a minimum of 35 of the 50 targets presented (70 percent) to successfully pass this event. \nThe leader annotates the official record of training DA Form 7489. \nI-90. Soldiers begin Table VI tasks by moving into the firing position following administrative commands \nfrom the tower operator. Tower operators use administrative commands to control the flow of the range, \nmovement of personnel, and other command and control purposes. Table I-57 provides an example of the \nadministrative commands for moving a new firing order into position.  \n \nTable I-57.
