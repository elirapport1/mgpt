    "page: 19, manual name: riflecarbine\n20 November 2019\nTC 3-22.9, C3\nix\nIntroduction \nThis manual is comprised of nine chapters and five appendices, and is specifically tailored \nto the individual Soldier’s use of the M4- or M16-series weapon. This TC provides specific \ninformation about the weapon, aiming devices, attachments, followed by sequential chapters \non the tactical employment of the weapon system.  \nThe training circular itself is purposely organized in a progressive manner, each chapter or \nappendix building on the information from the previous section. This organization provides \na logical sequence of information which directly supports the Army’s training strategy for \nthe weapon at the individual level.  \nChapters 1 through 4 describe the weapon, aiming devices, mountable weapons, and \naccessories associated with the rifle and carbine. General information is provided in the \nchapters of the manual, with more advanced information placed in appendix A, Ammunition, \nand appendix B, Ballistics. \nChapters 5 through 9 provide the employment, stability, aiming, control and movement \ninformation.

It relies on the Soldier’s \nunderstanding of the weapon, how it functions, its capabilities, the \ncapabilities of the optics and ammunition, and how to properly \nemploy those capabilities to achieve mastery through the \napplication of the functional elements of the shot process. \nThis chapter describes the principles of proper weapons handling, \ntactical applications and control measures for handling the \nweapons, and an overview of the concepts of overmatch as it \npertains to a Soldier’s individual weapon.  \n1-1. \nEach Soldier is responsible for placing accurate and effective fires on threat\ntargets with their individual weapon. This manual defines the functional elements of the\nshot process, the principles of operation of the weapon, the characteristics and\ndescription of ballistics and ammunition, and the various engagement techniques that\nare essential to build Soldier proficiency with their weapon. It includes standard drills\nand techniques that assist the Soldier to build, improve, and sustain their skills to achieve\naccurate and precise shots consistently during combat operations (see figure 1-1).\nFigure 1-1. Employment skills \n\n\n[Image page_21_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram is a graphical representation of the relationships between accuracy, precision, and consistency in shooting. \n\n- **Axes**: \n  - The vertical axis represents **Consistency** (ranging from **LOW** at the bottom to **HIGH** at the top).\n  - The horizontal axis represents **Accuracy** (ranging from **LOW** on the left to **HIGH** on the right).\n\n- **Target Circles**: \n  - There are four target circles positioned in a grid layout: two in the **high** accuracy zone (top) and two in the **low** accuracy zone (bottom). Each target has shots depicted, illustrating different levels of precision and consistency.\n\n- **Arrow**: \n  - An arrow from the bottom left (low accuracy, low consistency) to the top right (high accuracy, high consistency) suggests a desired progression or improvement in shooting performance.\n\n- **Definitions**: \n  - **Accuracy**: Defined as the ability to hit a desired target or point of aim.\n  - **Precision**: Defined as the ability to place the shot group and the desired point of impact.\n  - **Consistency**: Defined as the ability to routinely achieve accurate and precise shots. \n\nThis diagram effectively summarizes the importance of these three concepts in the context of improving shooting skills.",

Weapons\nhandling is built on three components; the Soldier, the weapon, and the environment:\n\nThe Soldier must maintain situational understanding of friendly forces, the\nstatus of the weapon, and the ability to evaluate the environment to properly\nhandle any weapon. The smart, adaptive, and disciplined Soldier is the\nprimary safety mechanism for all weapons under his control.\n\nThe weapon is the primary tool of the Soldier to defeat threats in combat.\nThe Soldier must know of and how to operate the mechanical safeties built\ninto the weapons they employ, as well as the principles of operation for those\nweapons.\n\nThe environment is the Soldier’s surroundings. The Soldier must be aware\nof muzzle discipline, the nature of the target, and what is behind it.\n1-3. \nTo safely and effectively handle weapons, Soldiers must be cognitively aware of\nthree distinct weapons handling measures:\n\nThe rules of firearms safety.\n\nWeapons safety status.\n\nWeapons control status.\n1-4. \nThese measures directly support the components of safe weapons handling. They\nare designed to provide redundant safety measures when handling any weapon or\nweapon system, not just rifles and carbines.\n1-5. \nThis redundancy allows for multiple fail-safe measures to provide the maximum\nlevel of safety in both training and operational environments. A Soldier would have to\nviolate two of the rules of firearms safety or violate a weapon safety status in order to\nhave a negligent discharge.\nNote. Unit standard operating procedures (SOPs), range SOPs, or the \noperational environment may dictate additional safety protocols; however, \nthe rules of firearms safety are always applied. If a unit requires Soldiers to \nviolate these safety rules for any reason, such as for the use of blank rounds \nor other similar training munitions during training, the unit commander must \ntake appropriate risk mitigation actions. \nRULES OF FIREARMS SAFETY \n1-6. \nThe Rules of Firearms Safety are standardized for any weapon a Soldier may\nemploy. Soldiers must adhere to these precepts during training and combat operations,\nregardless of the type of ammunition employed, except as noted above.\n\n",
    "page: 23, manual name: riflecarbine\nOverview \n20 November 2019\nTC 3-22.9, C3\n1-3\nRule 1: Treat Every Weapon as if it is Loaded \n1-7. \nAny weapon handled by a Soldier must be treated as if it is loaded and prepared\nto fire. Whether or not a weapon is loaded should not affect how a Soldier handles the\nweapon in any instance.\n1-8. \nSoldiers must take the appropriate actions to ensure the proper weapon status is\napplied during operations, whether in combat or training.\nRule 2: Never Point the Weapon at Anything You Do Not Intend to Destroy \n1-9. \nSoldiers must be aware of the orientation of their weapon’s muzzle and what is\nin the path of the projectile if the weapon fires. Soldiers must ensure the path between\nthe muzzle and target is clear of friendly forces, noncombatants, or anything the Soldier\ndoes not want to strike.\n1-10. When this is unavoidable, the Soldier must minimize the amount of time the\nmuzzle is oriented toward people or objects they do not intend to shoot, while\nsimultaneously applying the other three rules of fire arms safety.\nRule 3: Keep Finger Straight and Off the Trigger Until Ready to Fire \n1-11. Soldiers must not place their finger on the trigger unless they intend to fire the\nweapon. The Soldier is the most important safety feature on any weapon. Mechanical\nsafety devices are not available on all types of weapons. When mechanical safeties are\npresent, Soldiers must not solely rely upon them for safe operation knowing that\nmechanical measures may fail.\n1-12. Whenever possible, Soldiers should move the weapon to mechanical safe when a\ntarget is not present. If the weapon does not have a traditional mechanical safe, the\ntrigger finger acts as the primary safety.\nRule 4: Ensure Positive Identification of the Target and its Surroundings \n1-13. The disciplined Soldier can positively identify the target and knows what is in\nfront of and what is beyond it. The Soldier is responsible for all bullets fired from their\nweapon, including the projectile’s final destination.\n1-14. Application of this rule minimizes the possibility of fratricide, collateral damage,\nor damage to infrastructure or equipment. It also prepares the Soldier for any follow-on\nshots that may be required.\n\n",
    "page: 24, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 1 \n1-4\nTC 3-22.9, C3 \n20 November 2019\nWEAPON SAFETY STATUS \n1-15. The readiness of a Soldier’s weapon is termed as its weapon safety status (WSS).\nIt is a standard code that uses common colors (green, amber, red, and black) to represent\nthe level of readiness for a given weapon.\n1-16. Each color represents a specific series of actions that are applied to a weapon.\nThey are used in training and combat to place or maintain a level of safety relevant to\nthe current task or action of a Soldier, small unit, or group.\n1-17. The WSS ratings are evaluated by the level of safety measures applied to the\nweapon itself. Table 1-1 describes the general safe condition of the weapon for each\nWSS, based on the standard color scheme found in ADP 1-02.\nNote. If the component, assembly, or part described is unclear, refer to the \nweapon’s technical manual (TM) or chapter 2 of this publication. \nTable 1-1. General safe condition of the weapon for each weapon safety \nstatus \n1-18. All firers and leaders must be fluent in the general meaning of each WSS, how it\npertains to the weapon being employed, and the responsibilities of the firer to own each\nshot or burst. The following are the basic definitions for each WSS:\n\nGreen, “Fully Safe” – the weapon is clear, no ammunition is present the\nchamber is empty, and the fire selector switch is set to SAFE.\n\nAmber, “Substantially Safe” – a leader must clear and verify that the\nweapon’s bolt is forward, the chamber is empty, and ammunition is\nintroduced to the weapon. This is an administrative or preparatory WSS.\nLeaders use amber primarily for mounted operations and during combat\noperations when directed to maintain a substantially safe weapon with the\nability to rapidly transition and escalate to red or black, based on the situation.\nNote. WSS amber is not used in the live-fire events described in this \npublication. \n\n\n[Image page_24_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram outlines the weapon safety status using a color-coded system. It includes the following content:\n\n| Weapon Safety Status | General Description     | Color Amplifier   |\n|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|\n| GREEN                | Fully Safe              | Green              |\n| AMBER                | Substantially Safe      | Yellow             |\n| RED                  | Marginally Safe         | Red                |\n| BLACK                | Not Safe                | Black              |\n\nEach row corresponds to a different safety status, providing a clear description and associated color for quick reference.\n[Image page_24_image_2.png]: \n Disregard this image.",

A weapons control status (WCS) is a tactical method of fire control given by a\nleader that incorporates the tactical situation, rules of engagement for the area of\noperations, and expected or anticipated enemy contact. The WCS outlines the target\nidentification conditions under which friendly elements may engage a perceived threat\nwith direct fire.\n1-21. Table 1-2 provides a description of the standard WCS used during tactical\noperations, both in training and combat. They describe when the firer is authorized to\nengage a threat target once the threat conditions have been met.\nTable 1-2. Weapons Control Status \nWEAPONS \nCONTROL STATUS \nDESCRIPTION \nWEAPONS HOLD \nEngage only if engaged or ordered to engage. \nWEAPONS TIGHT \nEngage only if target is positively identified as enemy. \nWEAPONS FREE \nEngage targets not positively identified as friendly. \n1-22. A weapon control status and a weapons safety status are both implemented and\navailable to leaders to prevent fratricide and limit collateral damage. These postures or\nstatuses are typically suited to the area of operation or type of mission and should always\nbe clearly outlined to all Soldiers, typically in the operations order (OPORD), warning\norder (WARNORD), or fragmentary order (FRAGORD).\nOVERMATCH \n1-23. Overmatch is the Soldier applying their learned skills, employing their\nequipment, leveraging technology, and applying the proper force to create an unfair fight\nin favor of the Soldier. To achieve and maintain overmatch against any threat, this\npublication focuses on providing information that develops the Soldier’s direct fire\nengagement skills using the following attributes:\n\nSmart – the ability to routinely generate understanding through changing\nconditions.\n\nFast – the ability to physically and cognitively outmaneuver adversaries.\n\nLethal – deadly in the application of force.\n\nPrecise – consistently accurate in the application of power to ensure deliver\nof the right effects in time, space, and purpose.\n1-24. This requires the Soldier to understand the key elements that build the unfair\nadvantage and exploit them at every opportunity during tactical operations. The\ncomponents of overmatch are:\n\n\n[Image page_30_image_1.png]: \n Disregard this image.",
    "page: 31, manual name: riflecarbine\nOverview \n20 November 2019 \nTC 3-22.9, C3 \n1-11\n\nTarget detection, acquisition, and identification – the ability of the Soldier\nto detect and positively identify any suspected target as hostile at greater\ndistances than their adversary. This relies upon Soldier training and their\nability to leverage the capabilities of their optics, thermals, and sensors.\n\nEngagement range – provide the Soldier with weapons, aiming devices, and\nammunition capable of striking and defeating a threat at a greater range than\nthe adversary can detect or engage the friendly force with effective fires.\n\nLimited visibility – provide the Soldier to make operations during limited\nvisibility an advantage through technology and techniques, and compound\ntheir adversary’s disadvantages during those conditions.\n\nPrecision – provide a weapon and ammunition package that enhances the\nSoldier’s consistent application of shots with a level of precision greater than\nthe adversary’s.\n\nSpeed – the weapon, aiming devices, and accessories a Soldier employs must\nseamlessly work in unison, be intuitive to use, and leverage natural motion\nand manipulations to facilitate rapid initial and subsequent shots during an\nengagement at close quarters, mid-, and extended ranges.\n\nTerminal performance – ensures that precise shots delivered at extended\nranges provide the highest probability to defeat the threat through\nexceptional ballistic performance.\n1-25. Although not a component of overmatch, exceptional training is critical to create\nsmart, fast, lethal, and precise Soldiers. Training builds proficiency in a progressive,\nlogical, and structured manner and provides Soldiers the skills necessary to achieve\novermatch against any adversary. This requires the training program to provide\nexperience to the Soldier in all the components of overmatch to their fullest extent\npossible in the shortest amount of time.\nTARGET DETECTION, ACQUISITION, AND IDENTIFICATION \n1-26. The first component of overmatch at the Soldier level is the ability to detect\ntargets as far away as possible during limited and low visibility conditions. This manual\ndescribes the aiming devices for the service rifle that enhance the Soldier’s target\ndetection and acquisition skills. The Soldier must be able to detect, acquire, and identify\ntargets at ranges beyond the maximum effective range of their weapon and ammunition.\n1-27. This publication also provides key recognition information to build the Soldier’s\nskills in correctly identifying potential targets as friend, foe, or noncombatant (neutral)\nonce detected.\nENGAGEMENT RANGE \n1-28. To ensure small unit success, the Soldier requires weapon systems that can\neffectively engage threats at ranges greater than those of their adversaries. This creates\na standoff distance advantage that allows friendly forces to destroy the target outside the\nthreat’s maximum effective range.\n\n\n[Image page_31_image_1.png]: \n Disregard this image.",
    "page: 32, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 1 \n1-12\nTC 3-22.9, C3 \n20 November 2019\n1-29. Range overmatch provides a tactical engagement buffer that accommodates the\nSoldier’s time to engage with precision fires. For example, a Soldier that has the\ncapability to effectively engage personnel targets at a range of 500 meters will have\nrange overmatch of 10 to 20 percent over a threat rifleman. That 10 to 20 percent range\ndifference is equivalent to a distance of 40 to 80 meters, which is approximately the\ndistance a maneuvering threat can traverse in 15 to 40 seconds.\n1-30. Figure 1-6 portrays the battlefield from the Soldier’s perspective. With mobile,\nmaneuvering threats, the target acquisition capabilities must compliment the\nengagement of those threats at the maximum effective range of the weapon, optic, and\nammunition.\nFigure 1-6. Small unit range overmatch \nLIMITED VISIBILITY \n1-31. Soldiers must be able to detect, acquire, identify, and engage threats in all light\nconditions, regardless of the tactical situation. To provide that capability, aiming devices\nare provided that minimize the effects of limited visibility, but not completely.\n1-32. Image intensifiers and thermal optics provide a significant overmatch capability,\nbut they also have limitations and disadvantages. A general discussion of their\ncapabilities, particularly what those systems can view within the spectrum of light is\nprovided. Soldiers must understand what can be “seen” or viewed and what cannot when\nusing their assigned equipment. Understanding the advantages and limitations of their\nequipment has a direct impact on force protection, fratricide and collateral damage\nprevention, and maintaining overmatch during tactical operations.\nPRECISION \n1-33. The Army standard service rifle is designed with a specific level of accuracy out\nto its maximum effective range. This level of accuracy is more consistent and reliable\n\n\n[Image page_32_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram illustrates three distinct ranges relevant to military personnel:\n\n1. **Detection Range**: This is the outermost arc, indicating the distance within which an individual or threat can be detected.\n  \n2. **Range Overmatch Distance**: This is the middle arc, representing a distance at which a military force has a significant advantage over potential threats.\n\n3. **Threat Engagement Range**: This is the innermost arc, defining the distance at which a threat can be effectively engaged.\n\nAt the bottom of the diagram, a figure of a soldier is depicted, indicating the perspective from which these ranges are considered.\n[Image page_32_image_2.png]: \n Disregard this image.",

The Soldier must \nbuild the skills to use them effectively to deliver precision fires during tactical \nengagements.  \nSPEED \n1-34. The close fight requires rapid manipulations, a balance of speed and accuracy,\nand very little environmental concerns. Soldiers must move quickly and efficiently\nthrough their manipulations of the fire control to maintain the maximum amount of\nmuzzle orientation on the threat through the shot process. This second-nature efficiency\nof movement only comes from regular practice, drills, and repetition.\n1-35. The foundation of speed of action is built through understanding the weapon,\nammunition, ballistics, and principles of operation of the associated aiming devices. It\nis reinforced during drills (appendix D), and the training program of the unit.\n1-36. The goal of training to overmatch is to increase the speed at which the Soldier\ndetects a threat, identifies it as hostile, and executes the shot process with the desired\ntarget effect. This manual is constructed to provide the requisite information in a\nprogressive manner to build and reinforce Soldier understanding, confidence, and ability\nto execute tactical operations with speed and smooth fluidity of motion.\nTERMINAL BALLISTIC PERFORMANCE \n1-37. Terminal ballistic performance is the actions of a projectile from the time it strikes\nan object downrange until it comes to rest. The ammunition used with the service rifle\nperforms exceptionally well out to its maximum effective range and beyond. This\nmanual provides information on the various munition types available for training and\ncombat, their capabilities and purpose, and the service (combat) round’s terminal\nballistic performance (see appendix A, Ammunition, and appendix B, Ballistics).\n1-38. Soldiers must understand the capabilities of their ammunition, whether designed\nfor training or combat use. That understanding creates a respect for the weapon and\nammunition, reinforces the precepts of safe weapons handling, and an understanding of\nthe appropriate skills necessary to deliver lethal fires.\n1-39. Soldiers that understand the “how” and “why” of their weapon system, aiming\ndevices, ammunition, and procedures work or function develops a more comprehensive\nunderstanding. That level of understanding, coupled with a rigorous training program\nthat builds and strengthens their skills create more proficient Soldiers. The proficiencies\nand skills displayed during training translate into smart, fast, lethal and precise Soldiers\nfor the small unit during decisive action combat operations.\n\n",

These weapons are described as a lightweight, 5.56-mm, magazine-fed, gas-\noperated, air-cooled, shoulder-fired rifle or carbine. They fire in semiautomatic (single-\nshot), three-round burst, or in automatic mode using a selector lever, depending on the\nvariant. The weapon system has a standardized mounting surface for various optics,\npointers, illuminators, and equipment, to secure those items with common mounting and\nadjustment hardware.\n2-2. \nEach service rifle weapon system consists of components, assemblies,\nsubassemblies, and individual parts. Soldiers must be familiar with these items and how\nthey interact during operation.\n\nComponents are uniquely identifiable group of fitted parts, pieces,\nassemblies or subassemblies that are required and necessary to perform a\ndistinctive function in the operation of the weapon.

Cooling is the process of dissipating heat from the weapon during firing.\nAlthough not part of the cycle of functioning, cooling the weapon during firing is critical\nto ensure the weapon continues to operate efficiently. Firing a round generates heat and\npressure within the chamber and bore, which radiates outward through the metal of the\nbarrel.\n2-20. The temperature generated by the burning of propellant powders is over one\nthousand degrees Fahrenheit. Some of the heat produced during firing is retained in the\nchamber, bore, and barrel during firing and poses a significant hazard to the firer.\n2-21. How this heat is absorbed by the weapon and dissipated or removed, is a function\nof engineering and design. Lightweight weapons like the M4 and M16 do not have\nsufficient mass to withstand thermal stress efficiently. The weapon system must have a\nmeans to radiate the heat outward, away from the barrel to allow continuous firing.\n2-22. There are three methods to reduce the thermal stress on a weapon. The M4- and\nM16-series of weapons use all three of these methods to varying degrees to cool the\nchamber, bore, and barrel to facilitate continuous operation. These methods of cooling\nare—\n\nRadiational cooling – allows for the dissipation of heat into the surrounding\ncooler air. This is the least efficient means of cooling, but is common to most\nsmall arms weapons, including the rifle and carbine.\n\nConduction cooling – occurs when a heated object is in direct physical\ncontact with a cooler object. Conduction cooling on a weapon usually results\nfrom high chamber operating temperatures being transferred into\nsurrounding surfaces such as the barrel and receiver of the weapon. The\ntransfer from the chamber to the cooler metals has the net effect of cooling\nthe chamber. Thermal energy is then carried away by other means, such as\nradiant cooling, from these newly heated surfaces.\n\nConvection cooling – requires the presence of a moving air current. The\nmoving air has greater potential to carry away heat. The hand guards and\nARS of the rifle and carbine are designed to facilitate air movement. The\nheat shield reflects heat energy away from the hand guard and back towards\nthe barrel. The net effect is an updraft that brings the cooler air in from the\nbottom. This process establishes a convection cycle as heated air is\ncontinually replaced by cooler air.\n2-23. Soldiers should be aware of the principles of the weapon’s cooling methods’\ndirect effects on their line of sight when viewing a target through an aiming device.\nDissipating heat along the length of the barrel can create a mirage effect within the line\nof sight which can cause a significant error to the true point of aim when using magnified\noptics.\n\n",

A major concern for the planning and use of thermal and other optics to aid in the \ndetection process is understanding how they function, but more appropriately, what they \ncan “see”. Each device develops a digital representation of the scene or view it is \nobserving based on what frequencies or wavelengths it can detect within the \nelectromagnetic spectrum. (Note: Thermal devices see differences in heat.) \n \nThermal optics. This equipment operates in the mid- and far-wavelength of \nthe infrared band, which is the farthest of the infrared wavelengths from \nvisible light. Thermal optics cannot translate (“see”) visible light. Thermal \noptics cannot “see” infrared equipment such as infrared (IR) strobe lights, IR \nchemical lights, illuminators, or laser pointers. They can only identify \nemitted radiation in the form of heat (see figure 3-5 on page 3-7).  \n \nImage intensifiers (I2). This equipment, such as night vision devices, use \nthe near area of the infrared spectrum closest to the frequencies of visible \nlight, as well as visible light to create a digital picture of the scene. These \nsystems cannot “see” or detect heat or heat sources. \n3-12. These sights generally operate on the principles of convection, conduction, and \nradiation (mentioned in chapter 2 of this publication). The sight “picks up” or translates \nthe IR wavelength (or light) that is emitted from a target scene through one of those \nthree methods.  \n3-13. Things to be aware of (planning considerations) with these optics are that they \nhave difficulty imaging through the following: \n \nRain – absorbs the IR emitted by the target, makes it difficult to see. \n \nWater – acts as a mirror and generally reflects IR, providing a false thermal \nscene. \n \nGlass – acts similar to water, interfering with the sensor’s ability to \naccurately detect emitted radiation behind the glass. \n3-14. Situations where IR can see better are the following:  \n \nSmoke – will not obscure a target unless the chemical obscurant is extremely \nhot and dense, or if the target is sitting on top of the smoke source. \n \nDust – may interfere with the accurate detection of the emitted thermal \nsignature due to dust and debris density between the sensor and the target \nscene. Dust typically does not obscure the IR signature unless its temperature \nis similar to the target's. \n3-15. Figure 3-5 depicts the areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. It details the various \nwavelengths within the spectrum where the aiming devices, night vision devices, and \nequipment operate. It illustrates where these items can and cannot “see” the others, \nrespectively, within their operating range. \n\n",

Optics are sighting aids for rifles and carbines that provide enhanced aim point \nreticles, and may include magnified fields of view. Optics are specific to day operations, \nalthough may be used during limited visibility or night operations. They do not have any \nmethod of enhancing low light conditions. \n3-17. Optics enhance the Soldier’s ability to engage targets accurately and at extended \nranges (see figure 3-6 on page 3-9). The available optics for mounting on the M4- and \nM16-series modular weapon system are: \n \nIron Sight. \n \nBack Up Iron Sight (BUIS). \n \nCCO, M68. \n \nRCO, M150. \nIRON SIGHT \n3-18.

The close combat optic (CCO), M68 is a non-telescopic (unmagnified) reflex\nsight that is designed for the “eyes-open” method of sighting (see figure 3-8). It provides\nSoldiers the ability to fire with one or two eyes open, as needed for the engagement\nsequence in the shot process.\n3-25. The CCO provides a red-dot aiming point using a 2 or 4 MOA diameter reticle,\ndepending on the variant. The red dot aiming point follows the horizontal and vertical\nmovement of the firer’s eye, allowing the firer to remain fixed on the target. No centering\nor focusing on the front sight post is required. There are three versions of the CCO\navailable in the force.\nNote. Re-tighten the torque-limiting knob after firing the first three to five \nrounds to fully seat the M68.  \n3-26. The CCO is zeroed to the weapon. It must remain matched with the same weapon,\nattached at the same slot in the attached rail system or be re-zeroed. If the CCO must be\nremoved for storage, Soldiers must record the serial number and the rail slot to retain\nzero.\nNote. The weapon must be re-zeroed if the CCO is not returned to the same \nrail slot on the adaptive rail system. \nAdvantages \n3-27. The CCO offers a distinct speed advantage over iron sights in most if not all\nengagements. The adjustments on brightness allow the Soldier to have the desired\nbrightness from full daylight to blackout conditions.\n3-28. The CCO is the preferred optic for close quarter’s engagements.\nDisadvantages \n3-29.

The RCO (see figure 3-9) is designed to provide enhanced target identification\nand hit probability for the M4-/M4A1- or M16-series weapon.\n3-32. There are several versions of the RCO available for use across the force. Soldiers\nmust be familiar with their specific version of their assigned RCO, and be\nknowledgeable on the specific procedures for alignment and operation (see figure 3-9\nfor RCO azimuth and elevation adjustments).\n3-33. The reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges to 800\nmeters using the bullet drop compensator (BDC) (see figure 3-10 on page 3-15). It is\ndesigned with dual illuminated technology, using fiber optics for daytime employment\nand tritium for nighttime and low-light use.\n3-34. The RCO is a lightweight, rugged, fast, and accurate 4x power optic scope\nspecifically designed to allow the Soldier to keep both eyes open while engaging targets\nand maintain maximum situational awareness.\nAdvantages \n3-35. The bullet drop compensator (BDC) is accurate for extended range engagements\nusing either M855 or M855A1 ball ammunition. The ballistic difference between the\ntwo rounds is negligible under 400 meters and requires no hold determinations.\n3-36. This is a widely fielded optic that is rugged, durable, and operates in limited light\nconditions. The self-illuminating reticle allows for continuous operations through end\nevening nautical twilight (EENT).\nDisadvantages \n3-37. This optic’s ocular view is limited when engaging targets in close quarters\nengagements. This requires additional training to master the close quarter’s skills while\nemploying the RCO to achieve overmatch against the threat.\n3-38. The RCO reticle does not include stadia lines. Windage must be applied by the\nshooter from a determined estimate. The RCO has a specific eye relief of 70-mm\n(millimeter) or 1.5 inches. If the eye relief is not correct, the image size will be reduced.\n3-39. The fiber optic illuminator element can provide excessive light to the reticle\nduring certain conditions that produce a glare. The RCO does not have a mechanical or\nbuilt in method to reduce the effects of the glare created. The increased lighting may\ninterfere with the shooter’s point of aim and hold determinations. Soldiers may use\nalternate methods to reduce the glare by reducing the amount of fiber optic exposed to\ndirect sunlight during operating conditions.\n3-40.

Thermal sights are target acquisition and aiming sensors that digitally replicate\nthe field of view based on an estimation of the temperature. They use advanced forward-\nlooking infrared technology that identify the infrared emitted radiation (heat) of a field\nof view, and translate those temperatures into a gray- or color-scaled image. The TWS\nis capable of target acquisition under conditions of limited visibility, such as darkness,\nsmoke, fog, dust, and haze, and operates effectively during the day and night.\n3-42. The TWS is composed of five functional groups:  (See figure 3-10.)\n\nObjective lens – receives IR light emitting from an object and its\nsurroundings. The objective lens magnifies and projects the IR light.\n\nDetector assembly – senses the IR light and coverts it to a video signal.\n\nSensor assembly – the sensor electronics processes the video for display on\nthe liquid crystal display (LCD) array in the field of view.\n\nLCD array/eyepiece – the LCD array provides the IR image along with the\nreticle selected. The light from the LCD array is at the eyepiece.\n\nUser controls – the control electronics allows the user to interface with the\ndevice to adjust contrast, thermal gain, sensitivity, reticle display, and\nmagnification.\nFigure 3-10. Thermal weapon sight example \n3-43. A small detector used in thermal sensors or optics to identify IR radiation with\nwavelengths between 3 and 30 μm (micrometer).

The various models and versions are identified in their official\nmodel nomenclature:\n\nVersion 1 (v1) – Light Weapons Thermal Sight (LWTS).\n\nVersion 2 (v2) – Medium Weapons Thermal Sight (MWTS).\n\nVersion 3 (v3) – Heavy Weapons Thermal Sight (HWTS).\n3-45. Weapons thermal sights are silent, lightweight, and compact, and have durable\nbattery-powered IR imaging sensors that operate with low battery consumption. (See\nfigure 3-11.)\nAdvantages \n3-46. Military grade weapon thermal weapon sights are designed with the following\nadvantages:\n\nSmall and lightweight.\n\nReal-time imagery. Devices provide real-time video of the thermal scene\nimmediately after power on.\n\nLong-lasting battery life. Low power consumption over time.\n\nReliable. Long mean time between failures (MTBF).\n\nQuiet. The lack of a cooling element allows for a very low operating noise\nlevel.\n\nOne optic fits on multiple weapons. The use of the ARS rail mounting bracket\nallows for the same optic to be used on other weapons.\n\nThe F- and G-models attach in front of other aiming devices to improve their\ncapabilities and eliminate the zeroing procedures for the device.\nDisadvantages \n3-47. These devices have limitations that Soldiers should take into consideration,\nparticularly during combat operations. The primary disadvantages are:\n\nCannot interpret (“see”) multispectral infrared. These systems view a specific\nwavelength for emitted radiation (heat variations), and do not allow viewing\nof all aiming and marking devices at night.\n\nReliance on rechargeable batteries and charging stations. Although the\nbatteries are common and have a relatively long battery life, additional\nequipment is required to charge them. If common nonrechargeable (alkaline)\nbatteries are used, a separate battery adapter is typically required.\n\nCannot interpret thermal signatures behind glass or water effectively.\n\nThermal systems cannot always detect friendly marking systems worn by\ndismounts.\n\n",

The laser is \nactivated by a selector switch on the device or by a remote mechanism installed on the \nweapon. The basic two modes or functions are: \n \nPointer. When used as a pointer or aiming device, a small, pin-point beam \nis emitted from the device. The IR beam provides an infrared visible point \nwhen it strikes an object or target. The IR beam operates in the 400 to 800 \nnanometer wavelength and can only be seen by I2 optics, such as the \nAN-PVS-7 or -14 night vision devices. \n \nIlluminator. Typically used to illuminate a close quarters area as an infrared \nflood light. The illuminator provides a flood-light effect for the Soldier when \nused in conjunction with I2 night vision devices. \nNote. Laser is an acronym for light amplified stimulated emitted radiation, \nbut is predominantly used as a proper noun. \n3-50. The following devices (see table 3-1) are the most common laser pointing devices \navailable for use on the M4- and M16-weapons. \nTable 3-1.

AN/PEQ-2 aiming devices are Class IIIb laser devices that emit a collimated\nbeam of IR light for precise aiming and a separate IR beam for illumination of the target\nor target area (see figure 3-14 on page 3-21). Both beams can be independently zeroed\nto the weapon and to each other. The beams can be operated individually or in\ncombination in both high and low power settings.\nNote. The IR illuminator is equipped with an adjustable bezel to vary the size \nof the illumination beam based on the size and distance of the target. \n3-52. The aiming devices are used with night observation devices (NODs) and can be\nused as handheld illuminators/pointers or mounted on the weapon with the included\nbrackets and accessory mounts. In the weapon-mounted mode, the aiming devices can\nbe used to direct fire and to illuminate and designate targets.\n3-53. The aiming light is activated by pressing on either the ON/OFF switch lever, or\nthe button on the optional cable switch. Either switch connects power from two AA\nbatteries to an internal electronic circuit which produces the infrared laser. Internal\nlenses focus the infrared light into a narrow beam. The direction of the beam is\ncontrolled by rotating the mechanical Adjusters with click detents. These adjusters are\nused to zero the aiming light to the weapon.\n3-54. Once zeroed to the weapon, the aiming light projects the beam along the line of\nfire of the weapon. The optical baffle prevents off-axis viewing of the aiming light beam\nby the enemy.\nCAUTION \nA safety block is provided for training purposes to \nlimit the operator from selecting high power modes of \noperation. \n3-55.

Once complete, the Soldier should mark the mounting bracket to identify the\ntightened position with a permanent marker. Marking the mounting bracket allows for\nrapid identification of loosening hardware during firing. Soldiers must periodically\nverify the mounting hardware does not loosen during operation. During zeroing or zero\nconfirmation operations, Soldiers should retighten the mounting hardware after the first\nfive rounds.\n4-5. \nSoldiers must ensure the equipment is firmly affixed to the ARS before tie down\nis complete.

They provide assistance stabilizing the weapon or provide white-\nlight illumination for specific tactical operations. \n4-15. These devices are authorized as needed by the small unit. Some mountable \naccessories are aftermarket (commercial-off-the-shelf, or COTS) items that use the ARS \nfor semipermanent attachment. \nBIPOD \n4-16. Bipods are highly adjustable that enhance stability within the battle space \nenvironment. They are secured by the front sling swivel or the advanced rail system on \nthe foregrip of the weapon. They can be used in combination with a sand sock or other \nbuttstock support to provide an extremely stable firing platform. (See figure 4-4.) \n4-17. The bipod is an additional means to stabilize the weapon in various shooting \npositions. Despite primarily being used in prone position, bipods can be used for \nadditional support in alternate shooting positions while using barricade supports. The \nbipod provides additional support which facilitates acquisition of muscle relaxation and \nnatural point of aim. The use of bipods in barricade shooting can increase the Soldier's \nefficiency and probability of a first round hit while engaging targets. \n \nFigure 4-4.

Vertical foregrips (VFGs) assist in transitioning from target to target in close \nquarter combat. (See figure 4-5.) \n4-19. The further out the Soldier mounts the VFG, the smoother and quicker his \ntransitions between multiple targets will be, however he should not mount it so far \nforward that using the VFG is uncomfortable. \n \nFigure 4-5. Vertical foregrip example \nFOREGRIP WITH INTEGRATED BIPODS \n4-20. VFGs with integrated bipods are acceptable for common use. They combine the \nVFG capability with a small, limited adjustment bipod. They typically lack the full \nadjustment capabilities of full bipods, but provide a compact stable extrusion for the \nfirer.  \nMOUNTED LIGHTS \n4-21. The weapon-mounted lights are commonly issued throughout the Army. The \npurpose of the weapon mounted lights is to provide illumination and assist in target \nacquisition and identification during limited visibility operations. \n4-22. Most weapon mounted lights provide selection between white light and infrared \ncapabilities. Employment of the weapon mounted light is based upon mission, enemy, \nterrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, civil considerations \n(METT-TC) and unit SOP. The weapon mounted lights should be mounted in such a \nmanner that the Soldier can activate and deactivate them efficiently and their placement \ndoes not hinder the use of any other attachment or accessory. They must be attached in \nsuch a manner as to prevent negligent or unintentional discharge of white light \nillumination during movement or climbing. \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image page_82_image_1.jpeg]: \n Disregard this image.",
    "page: 83, manual name: riflecarbine\n \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n5-1 \nChapter 5 \nEMPLOYMENT \nThe rifleman’s primary role is to engage the enemy with well-aimed \nshots. (Refer to ATP 3-21.8 for more information.) In this capacity, \nthe rate of fire for the M4 rifle is not based on how fast the Soldier \ncan pull the trigger. Rather, it is based on how fast the Soldier can \nconsistently acquire and engage the enemy with accuracy and \nprecision. \nConsistently hitting a target with precision is a complex interaction \nof factors immediately before, during, and after the round fires. \nThese interactions include maintaining postural steadiness, \nestablishing and maintaining the proper aim on the target, \nstabilization of the weapon while pressing the trigger, and adjusting \nfor environmental and battlefield conditions.  \n5-1. \nEvery Soldier must adapt to the firing situation, integrate the rules of firearms \nsafety, manipulate the fire control, and instinctively know when, how, and where to \nshoot. It is directly influenced by the Soldier’s ability to hit the target under conditions \nof extreme stress: \n \nAccurately interpret and act upon perceptual cues related to the target, front \nand rear sights, rifle movement, and body movement. \n \nExecute minute movements of the hands, elbows, legs, feet, and cheek. \n \nCoordinate gross-motor control of their body positioning with fine-motor \ncontrol of the trigger finger. \n5-2. \nRegardless of the weapon system, the goal of shooting remains constant: well-\naimed shots. To achieve this end state there are two truths. Soldier’s must—  \n \nProperly point the weapon (sight alignment and sight picture). \n \nFire the weapon without disturbing the aim. \n5-3. \nTo accomplish this, Soldiers must master sight alignment, sight picture, and \ntrigger control. \n \nSight alignment – sight alignment is the relationship between the aiming \ndevice and the firer’s eye. To achieve proper and effective aim, the focus of \nthe firer’s eye needs to be on the front sight post or reticle. The Soldier must \nmaintain sight alignment throughout the aiming process. \n \nSight picture – the sight picture is the placement of the aligned sights on the \ntarget. \n \nTrigger control – the skillful manipulation of the trigger that causes the rifle \nto fire without disturbing the aim.  \n\n",
    "page: 84, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 5 \n5-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nSHOT PROCESS \n5-4. \nThe shot process is the basic outline of an individual engagement sequence all \nfirers consider during an engagement, regardless of the weapon employed. The shot \nprocess formulates all decisions, calculations, and actions that lead to taking the shot. \nThe shot process may be interrupted at any point before the sear disengaging and firing \nthe weapon should the situation change. \n5-5. \nThe shot process has three distinct phases:  \n \nPre-shot. \n \nShot. \n \nPost-shot.  \n5-6. \nTo achieve consistent, accurate, well-aimed shots, Soldiers must understand and \ncorrectly apply the shot process. The sequence of the shot process does not change, \nhowever, the application of each element vary based on the conditions of the \nengagement.  \n5-7. \nEvery shot that the Soldier takes has a complete shot process. Grouping, for \nexample, is simply moving through the shot process several times in rapid succession.  \n5-8. \nThe shot process allows the Soldier to focus on one cognitive task at a time. The \nSoldier must maintain the ability to mentally organize the shot process’s tasks and \nactions into a disciplined mental checklist, and focus their attention on activities which \nproduce the desired outcome; a well-aimed shot.  \n5-9. \nThe level of attention allocated to each element during the shot process is \nproportional to the conditions of each individual shot. Table 5-1 provides an example of \na shot process.  \nTable 5-1.

    "page: 85, manual name: riflecarbine\nEmployment \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n5-3 \nFUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS OF THE SHOT PROCESS \n5-10. Functional elements of the shot process are the linkage between the Soldier, the \nweapon system, the environment, and the target that directly impact the shot process and \nultimately the consistency, accuracy, and precision of the shot. When used \nappropriately, they build a greater understanding of any engagement.  \n5-11. The functional elements are interdependent. A accurate shot, regardless of \nweapon system, requires the Soldier to establish, maintain, and sustain—  \n \nStability – the Soldier stabilizes the weapon to provide a consistent base to \nfire from and maintain through the shot process until the recoil pulse has \nceased. This process includes how the Soldier holds the weapon, uses \nstructures or objects to provide stability, and the Soldier’s posture on the \nground during an engagement. \n \nAim – the continuous process of orienting the weapon correctly, aligning the \nsights, aligning on the target, and the appropriate lead and elevation (hold) \nduring a target engagement. \n \nControl – all the conscious actions of the Soldier before, during, and after \nthe shot process that the Soldier specifically is in control of. The first of \nwhich is trigger control. This includes whether, when, and how to engage. It \nincorporates the Soldier as a function of safety, as well as the ultimate \nresponsibility of firing the weapon. \n \nMovement – the process of the Soldier moving during the engagement \nprocess. It includes the Soldier’s ability to move laterally, forward, \ndiagonally, and in a retrograde manner while maintaining stabilization, \nappropriate aim, and control of the weapon.  \n5-12. These elements define the tactical engagement that require the Soldier to make \nadjustments to determine appropriate actions, and compensate for external influences on \ntheir shot process. When all elements are applied to the fullest extent, Soldiers will be \nable to rapidly engage targets with the highest level of precision.  \n5-13. Time, target size, target distance, and the Soldier’s skills and capabilities \ndetermine the amount of effort required of each of the functional elements to minimize \ninduced errors of the shot.  \n5-14. Each weapon, tactical situation, and sight system will have preferred techniques \nfor each step in the shot process and within the functional elements to produce precision \nand accuracy in a timely manner. How fast or slow the shooter progresses through the \nprocess is based on target size, target distance, and shooter capability.  \n5-15. The most complex form of shooting is under combat conditions when the Soldier \nis moving, the enemy is moving, under limited visibility conditions. Soldiers and leaders \nmust continue to refine skills and move training from the simplest shot to the most \ncomplex. Applying the functional elements during the shot process builds a firer’s speed \nwhile maintaining consistency, accuracy, and precision during complex engagements. \n5-16. Each of the functional elements and the Soldier actions to consider during the \nshot process are described later in this manual.  \n\n",
    "page: 86, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 5 \n5-4 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nTARGET ACQUISITION \n5-17. Target acquisition is the ability of a Soldier to rapidly recognize threats to the \nfriendly unit or formation. It is a critical Soldier function before any shot process begins. \nIt includes the Soldier’s ability to use all available optics, sensors, and information to \ndetect potential threats as quickly as possible. \n5-18. Target acquisition requires the Soldier to apply an acute attention to detail in a \ncontinuous process based on the tactical situation. The target acquisition process \nincludes all the actions a Soldier must execute rapidly: \n \nDetect potential threats (target detection). \n \nIdentify the threat as friend, foe, or noncombatant (target identification). \n \nPrioritize the threat(s) based on the level of danger they present (target \nprioritization). \nTARGET DETECTION \n5-19. Effective target detection requires a series of skills that Soldiers must master. \nDetection is an active process during combat operations with or without a clear or known \nthreat presence. All engagements are enabled by the Soldier’s detection skills, and are \nbuilt upon three skill sets: \n \nScan and search – a rapid sequence of various techniques to identify \npotential threats. Soldier scanning skills determine potential areas where \nthreats are most likely to appear. \n \nAcquire – a refinement of the initial scan and search, based on irregularities \nin the environment. \n \nLocate – the ability to determine the general location of a threat to engage \nwith accuracy or inform the small unit leader of contact with a potential \nthreat. \nScan and Search \n5-20. Scanning and searching is the art of observing an assigned sector. The goal of the \nscan and search is a deliberate detection of potential threats based on irregularities in the \nsurrounding environment. This includes irregular shapes, colors, heat sources, \nmovement, or actions the Soldier perceives as being “out of place,” as compared to the \nsurrounding area.  \n5-21. Soldiers use five basic search and scan techniques to detect potential threats in \ncombat situations: \n Rapid scan – used to detect obvious signs of threat activity quickly. It is \nusually the first method used, whether on the offense or fighting in the \ndefense. \n Slow scan – if no threats are detected during the rapid scan, Soldiers conduct \nthe more deliberate scan using various optics, aiming devices, or sensors. The \nslow scan is best conducted in the defense or during slow movement or \ntactical halts. \n\n",
    "page: 87, manual name: riflecarbine\nEmployment \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n5-5 \n Horizontal scan – are used when operating in restricted or urban terrain. It \nis a horizontal sweeping scan that focuses on key areas where potential threats \nmay be over watching their movement or position. \n Vertical scan – an up and down scan in restricted or urban environments to \nidentify potential threats that may be observing the unit from an elevated \nposition. \n Detailed search – used when no threats are detected using other scanning \nmethods. The detailed search uses aiming devices, thermal weapon systems, \nmagnified optics, or other sensors to slowly and methodically review \nlocations of interest where the Soldier would be positioned if they were the \nthreat (where would I be if I were them?) \nAcquire \n5-22. Target acquisition is the discovery of any object in the operational environment \nsuch as personnel, vehicles, equipment, or objects of potential military significance. \nTarget acquisition occurs during target scan and search as a direct result of observation \nand the detection process. \n5-23. During the scan and search, Soldiers are looking for “target signatures,” which \nare signs or evidence of a threat. Tactically, Soldiers will be looking for threat personnel, \nobstacles or mines (including possible improvised explosive devices [IEDs]), vehicles, \nor anti-tank missile systems. These target signatures can be identified with sight, sound, \nor smell.  \nDetection Best Practices \n5-24. Threat detection is a critical skill that requires thoughtful application of the \nsensors, optics, and systems at the Soldier’s disposal. Finding potential threats as quickly \nand effectively as possible provides the maximum amount of time to defeat the threat. \nSoldiers should be familiar with the following best practices to increase target detection: \n \nScan with the unaided eye first, then with a magnified optic. \n \nPractice using I2 and thermal optics in tandem during limited visibility. \n \nUnderstand the difference between I2 and thermal optics; what they can \n“see” and what they can’t. (See chapter 4 of this publication.) \n \nThermal optics are the preferred sight for target acquisition and engagement, \nday or night. \n \nDon’t search in the same area as others in the small unit. Overlap, but do not \nfocus on the same sector. \n \nPractice extreme light discipline during limited visibility including IR light \ndiscipline. \n \nThink as the threat. Search in areas that would be most advantageous from \ntheir perspective. \n \nDetecting threats is exponentially more difficult when operating in a \nchemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) environment. Practice \ndetection skills with personal protective equipment (PPE)/individual \n\n",
    "page: 88, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 5 \n5-6 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nprotective equipment (IPE) and understand the increased constraints and \nlimitations, day and night. \nLocate \n5-25. Target location is the determination of where a target is in your operational \nenvironment in relation to the shooter, small unit, or element. Locating a target or series \nof targets occurs as a result of the search and acquisition actions of each Soldier in the \nsmall unit. \n5-26. Once a target is located, the threat location can be rapidly and efficiently \ncommunicated to the rest of the unit. Methods used to announce a located target depend \non the individual’s specific position, graphic control measures for the operation, unit \nSOP, and time available. \nTARGET IDENTIFICATION \n5-27. Identifying (or discriminating) a target as friend, foe, or noncombatant (neutral) \nis the second step in the target acquisition process. The Soldier must be able to positively \nidentify the threat into one of three classifications: \n \nFriend. Any force, U.S. or allied, that is jointly engaged in combat \noperations with an enemy in a theater of operation. \n \nFoe (enemy combatant). Any individual who has engaged acts against the \nU.S. or its coalition partners in violation of the laws and customs of war \nduring an armed conflict. \n \nNoncombatants. Personnel, organizations, or agencies that are not taking a \ndirect part in hostilities. This includes individuals such as medical personnel, \nchaplains, United Nations observers, or media representatives or those out of \ncombat such as the wounded or sick. Organizations like the Red Cross or \nRed Crescent can be classified as noncombatants.  \n5-28. The identification process is complicated by the increasing likelihood of having \nto discriminate between friend/foe and combatant/noncombatant in urban settings or \nrestricted terrain. To mitigate fratricide and unnecessary collateral damage, Soldiers use \nall of the situational understanding tools available and develop tactics, techniques, and \nprocedures for performing target discrimination. \nFratricide Prevention \n5-29. Units have other means of designating friendly vehicles from the enemy. \nTypically, these marking systems are derived from the unit tactical standard operating \nprocedure (TACSOP) or other standardization publications, and applied to the \npersonnel, small units, or vehicles as required: \n \nMarkings. Unit markings are defined within the unit SOP. They distinctly \nidentify a vehicle as friendly in a standardized manner.  \n \nPanels. VS-17 panels provide a bright recognition feature that allows \nSoldiers to identify friendly vehicles through the day sight during unlimited \nvisibility. Panels do not provide a thermal signature. \n\n",
    "page: 89, manual name: riflecarbine\nEmployment \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n5-7 \n \nLighting. Chemical or light emitting diode lights provide a means of \nmarking vehicles at night. However, chemical lights are not visible through \na thermal sight. An IR variant is available for use with night vision devices. \nLighting systems do not provide for thermal identification during day or \nlimited visibility operations. \n \nBeacons and Strobes. Beacons and strobes are unit-procured, small-scale, \ncompact, battery-operated flashing devices that operate in the near infrared \nwavelength. They are clearly visibly through night vision optics, but cannot \nbe viewed through thermal optics.  \nNote. \nBeacons and strobes generate illumination signals that can \nonly be viewed by I2 optics. The signal cannot be viewed by thermal \noptics. Leaders and Soldiers are required to be aware of which optic \ncan effectively view these systems when developing their SOPs and \nwhen using them in training or combat. \nBeacons and strobes have the potential to be viewed by enemy \nelements with night vision capabilities. Units should tailor use of the \nbeacon based on METT-TC. \n \nSymbols. Unit symbols may be used to mark friendly vehicles. An inverted \nV, for example, painted on the flanks, rear, and fronts of a vehicle, aid in \nidentifying a target as friendly. These are typically applied in an area of \noperations and not during training. Symbol marking systems do not provide \nfor thermal identification during day or limited visibility operations. \nTARGET PRIORITIZATION \n5-30. When faced with multiple targets, the Soldier must prioritize each target and \ncarefully plan his shots to ensure successful target engagement. Mental preparedness \nand the ability to make split-second decisions are the keys to a successful engagement \nof multiple targets. The proper mindset will allow the Soldier to react instinctively and \ncontrol the pace of the battle, rather than reacting to the adversary threat. \n5-31. Targets are prioritized into three threat levels— \n \nMost dangerous. A threat that has the capability to defeat the friendly force \nand is preparing to do so. These targets must be defeated immediately. \n \nDangerous. A threat that has the capability to defeat the friendly force, but \nis not prepared to do so. These targets are defeated after all most dangerous \ntargets are eliminated. \n \nLeast dangerous. Any threat that does not have the ability to defeat the \nfriendly force, but has the ability to coordinate with other threats that are \nmore prepared. These targets are defeated after all threats of a higher threat \nlevel are defeated. \n\n",
    "page: 90, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 5 \n5-8 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \n5-32. When multiple targets of the same threat level are encountered, the targets are \nprioritized according to the threat they represent. The standard prioritization of targets \nestablishes the order of engagement. Firers engage similar threats by the following \nguide: \n \nNear before far. \n \nFrontal before flank. \n \nStationary before moving. \n5-33. The prioritization of targets provides a control mechanism for the shooter, and \nfacilitates maintaining overmatch over the presented threats. Firers should be prepared \ndeviate from the prioritization guide based on the situation, collective fire command, or \nchanges to the target’s activities. \n \n \n\n",
    "page: 91, manual name: riflecarbine\n \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n6-1 \nChapter 6 \nStability \nStability is the ability of the Soldier to create a stable firing platform \nfor the engagement. The Soldier stabilizes the weapon to provide a \nconsistent base from which to fire from and maintain through the \nshot process until the recoil impulse has ceased. This process \nincludes how the Soldier holds the weapon, uses structures or \nobjects to provide stability, and the Soldier’s posture on the ground \nduring an engagement. A stable firing platform is essential during \nthe shot process, whether the Soldier is stationary or moving. \nThis chapter provides the principles of developing a stable firing \nplatform, describes the interaction between the Soldier, weapon, the \nsurroundings, and the methods to achieve the greatest amount of \nstability in various positions. It explains how the stability functional \nelement supports the shot process and interacts and integrates the \nother three elements. Stability provides a window of opportunity to \nmaintain sight alignment and sight picture for the most accurate \nshot. \nSUPPORT \n6-1. \nStability is provided through four functions: support, muscle relaxation, natural \npoint of aim, and recoil management. These functions provide the Soldier the means to \nbest stabilize their weapon system during the engagement process. \n6-2. \nThe placement or arrangement of sandbags, equipment, or structures that directly \nprovide support to the upper receiver of the weapon to provide increased stability. This \nincludes the use of a bipod or vertical foregrip, bone and muscle support provided by \nthe shooter to stabilize the rifle. \n6-3. \nSupport can be natural or artificial or a combination of both. Natural support \ncomes from a combination of the shooter’s bones and muscles. Artificial support comes \nfrom objects outside the shooter’s body. The more support a particular position provides, \nthe more stable the weapon. \n \nLeg Position. The position of the legs varies greatly depending on the firing \nposition used. The position may require the legs to support the weight of the \nSoldier’s body, support the firing elbow, or to meet other requirements for \nthe firing position. When standing unsupported, the body is upright with the \nlegs staggered and knees slightly bent. In the prone, the firer’s legs may be \nspread apart flat on the ground or bent at the knee. In the sitting position, the \nlegs may also serve an intricate part of the firing position. \n\n",
    "page: 92, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 6 \n6-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \n \nStance/Center of Gravity. The physical position of a Soldier before, during, \nand after the shot that relates to the firer’s balance and posture. The \nposition/center of gravity does not apply when firing from the prone position. \nThe position/center of gravity specifically relates to the Soldier’s ability to \nmaintain the stable firing platform during firing, absorbing the recoil \nimpulses, and the ability to aggressively lean toward the target area during \nthe shot process. \n Firing Elbow. The placement of the firing elbow during the shot process. \nProper elbow placement provides consistent firing hand grip while standing, \nsitting, or kneeling, and provides support stability in the prone position. \n Nonfiring Elbow. The Soldier’s placement of the nonfiring elbow during \nthe shot process supports the rifle in the all positions. \n Firing Hand. Proper placement of the firing hand will aid in trigger control. \nPlace the pistol grip in the ‘V’ formed between the thumb and index finger. \nThe pressure applied is similar to a firm handshake grip. Different Soldiers \nhave different size hands and lengths of fingers, so there is no set position of \nthe finger on the trigger. To grip the weapon, the Soldier places the back \nstrap of the weapon’s pistol grip high in the web of his firing side hand \nbetween his thumb and index (trigger) finger. The Soldier’s trigger finger is \nindexed on the lower receiver, well outside the trigger guard and off the \nmagazine release to prevent inadvertent release of the magazine. The firing \nhand thumb (or trigger finger for left-handed firers) is indexed on top of the \nsafety selector switch. The Soldier grasps the pistol grip with his remaining \nthree fingers ensuring there is no gap between his middle finger and the \ntrigger guard. \n Nonfiring Hand. Proper placement of the non-firing hand is based on the \nfiring position and placement of the non-firing elbow to provide the stability \nof the weapon. Placement is adjusted during supported and unsupported \nfiring to maximize stability. The non-firing hand is placed as far forward as \ncomfortable without compromising the other elements of the position or \ninducing extreme shooter-gun angle. \n \nThe nonfiring hand supports the weight of the rifle by grasping the fore \narm. It should be a firm but relaxed grip. In all positions it should be as \nclose to the handguard as naturally possible to aid in recoil management. \n \nIf possible, the firer should strive to have the thumb of the nonfiring \nhand provide downward force on the handguard. The pressure will \nprovide the necessary force to assist in the management of the muzzle \nrise from recoil. \n \nIn all positions it should be as close to the end of the handguard as \nnaturally possible to aid in recoil management. \n \nDue to limited space on current MWS rails the above may not be \npossible but consideration should be given while mounting lasers to \nachieve an extended grip. \n \nButt Stock. Correct placement of the butt stock in the firing shoulder will \naid in achieving a solid stock weld. Side to side placement will vary \n\n",
    "page: 93, manual name: riflecarbine\nStability \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n6-3 \ndepending on equipment worn while firing. The butt stock is placed high \nenough in the shoulder to allow for an upright head position.  \n \nThe vertical placement of the butt stock will vary from firing position to \nfiring position. A general guideline to follow is: the higher the position \nfrom the ground, the higher the butt stock will be in the shoulder. \n \nThe term “butt stock” refers to both the butt stock (M16-series) and \ncollapsible butt stock (M4-series) for clarity.  \n \nStock Weld. Stock weld is the placement of the firer’s head on the stock of \nthe weapon. Correct stock weld is critical to sight alignment. The firer rests \nthe full weight of the head on the stock. The head position is as upright as \npossible to give the best vision through the aiming device. It allows for \nscanning additional targets not seen through the aiming device.  \n \nWhen establishing the stock weld, bring the rifle up to your head, not \nyour head down to the rifle. The firer’s head will remain in the same \nlocation on the stock while firing, but the location may change when \npositions are changed. The bony portion of the cheek placed on the stock \nis the basic starting point. Soldiers adapt to their facial structure to find \nthe optimal placement that allows for both sight alignment and repetitive \nplacement.  \n \nFigure 6-1 shows the differences in head placement, which effects sight \nalignment. The firer on the right is NOT resting the full weight of their \nhead on the stock. The picture on the left shows the skin of the firer’s \nhead being pushed down by the full weight of their head. This technique \ncan be quickly observed and corrected by a peer coach.  \nNote. Soldiers’ bodies vary with the amount of flesh and the bone structure \nof the face. Firers who apply downward force simply to achieve the \nappearance in the correct (left) image in figure 6-1, on page 6-4, will not have \nrelaxation and will not have a repeatable placement. The goal is to have \nalignment with consistent placement. \n\n",

Stock weld \nMUSCLE RELAXATION \n6-4. \nMuscle relaxation is the ability of the Soldier to maintain orientation of the \nweapon appropriately during the shot process while keeping the major muscle groups \nfrom straining to maintain the weapon system’s position. Relaxed muscles contribute to \nstability provided by support.  \n \nStrained or fatigued muscles detract from stability. \n \nAs a rule, the more support from the shooter’s bones the less he requires from \nhis muscles.  \n \nThe more skeletal support, the more stable the position, as bones do not \nfatigue or strain. \n \nAs a rule, the less muscle support required, the longer the shooter can stay in \nposition.  \nNATURAL POINT OF AIM  \n6-5. \nThe natural point of aim is the point where the barrel naturally orients when the \nshooter’s muscles are relaxed and support is achieved. The natural point of aim is built \nupon the following principles:  \n \nThe closer the natural point of aim is to the target, the less muscle support \nrequired.  \n \nThe more stable the position, the more resistant to recoil it is.  \n \nMore of the shooter’s body on the ground equals a more stable position.  \n \nMore of the shooter’s body on the ground equals less mobility for the shooter.  \n6-6. \nWhen a Soldier aims at a target, the lack of stability creates a wobble area, where \nthe sights oscillate slightly around and through the point of aim. If the wobble area is \nlarger than the target, the Soldier requires a steadier position or a refinement to their \nposition to decrease the size of his wobble area before trigger squeeze.  \n\n\n[Image page_94_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram illustrates two scenarios regarding the proper positioning of a military helmet or headgear in relation to the face of a soldier. \n\n- On the left side, labeled \"CORRECT,\" it shows a soldier wearing headgear properly, which appears to fit securely with adequate coverage and protection around the sides of the face.\n\n- The right side is labeled \"INCORRECT,\" depicting a soldier whose headgear is not positioned correctly. The illustration suggests that the gear does not provide proper coverage or fit, potentially compromising safety.\n\nBoth images emphasize the importance of wearing headgear correctly for optimal protection.",

The smaller the \nwobble area, the more precise the shot. \n6-7. \nTo check a shooter’s natural point of aim, the Soldier should assume a good \nsteady position and get to the natural pause. Close their eyes, go through one cycle, and \nthen open their eyes on the natural pause. Where the sights are laying at this time, is the \nnatural point of aim for that position. If it is not on their point of aim for their target, \nthey should make small adjustments to their position to get the reticle or front sight post \nback on their point of aim. The Soldier will repeat this process until the natural point of \naim is on the point of aim on their target.  \nRECOIL MANAGEMENT \n6-8. \nRecoil management is the result of a Soldier assuming and maintaining a stable \nfiring position which mitigates the disturbance of one's sight picture during the cycle of \nfunction of the weapon.  \n6-9. \nThe Soldier’s firing position manages recoil using support of the weapon system, \nthe weight of their body, and the placement of the weapon during the shot process. \nProper recoil management allows the sights to rapidly return to the target and allows for \nfaster follow up shots.  \nSHOOTER–GUN ANGLE \n6-10. The shooter gun-angle is the relationship between the shooters upper body and \nthe direction of the weapon. This angle is typically different from firing position to firing \nposition, and directly relates to the Soldier’s ability to control recoil. Significant changes \nin the shooter-gun angle can result in eye relief and stock weld changes. \nNote. Units with a mix of left and right handed shooters can take advantage \nof each Soldiers' natural carry positions, and place left-handed shooters on \nthe right flanks, and right-handed shooters on the left flanks, as their natural \ncarry alignment places the muzzle away from the core element, and outward \ntoward potential threats, and reduces the challenges of firing when moving \nlaterally. \nFIELD OF VIEW \n6-11. The field of view is the extent that the human eye can see at any given moment. \nThe field of view is based on the Soldier’s view without using magnification, optics, or \nthermal devices. The field of view is what the Soldier sees, and includes the areas where \nthe Soldier can detect potential threats. \n\n",

The Soldier must stabilize their weapon, whether firing from a stationary position \nor while on the move. To create a stabilized platform, Soldiers must understand the \nphysical relationship between the weapon system, the shooter’s body, the ground, and \nany other objects touching the weapon or shooter’s body. The more contact the shooter \nhas to the ground will determine how stable and effective the position is. The situation \nand tactics will determine the actual position used. \n6-30. When a shooter assumes a stable firing position, movement from muscle tension, \nbreathing, and other natural activities within the body will be transferred to the weapon \nand must be compensated for by the shooter.  \n6-31. Failing to create an effective platform to fire from is termed a stabilization \nfailure. A stabilization failure occurs when a Soldier fails to: \n \nControl the movement of the barrel during the arc of movement \n \nAdequately support the weapon system \n \nAchieve their natural point of aim.  \n6-32. These failures compound the firing occasion’s errors, which directly correlate to \nthe accuracy of the shot taken. To maximize the Soldier’s stability during the shot \nprocess, they correctly assume various firing positions when stationary, or offset the \ninduced errors with other firing skills during tactical movement. \n6-33. As a rule, positions that are lower to the ground provide a higher level of stability. \nWhen the center of gravity elevates the level of stability decreases as shown in \nfigure°6-8.  \n \n \n\n",

The nature of combat will not always allow time for a Soldier to get into a \nparticular position. Soldiers need to practice firing in a variety of positions, including \nappropriate variations. There are 12 firing positions with variations that are common to \nall Soldiers.  The positions are listed highest to lowest. The primary position is listed in \nbold, with the position variations in italics: \n \nStanding –  \n \nStanding, unsupported. \n \nStanding, supported. \n \nSquatting – This position allows for rapid engagement of targets when an \nobstruction blocks the firer from using standard positions. It provides the \nfirer a fairly well supported position by simply squatting down to engage, \nthen returning to a standing position once the engagement is complete. The \nsquatting position is generally unsupported. \n \nKneeling – The kneeling position is very common and useful in most combat \nsituations. The kneeling position can be supported or unsupported. \n \nKneeling, unsupported. \n \nKneeling, supported. \n \nSitting – There are three types of sitting positions: crossed-ankle, crossed-\nleg, and open-leg. All positions are easy to assume, present a medium \nsilhouette, provide some body contact with the ground, and form a stable \nfiring position. These positions allow easy access to the sights for zeroing.  \n \nSitting, crossed ankle. \n \nSitting, crossed leg. \n \nSitting, open leg. \n \nProne – The prone position is the most stable firing position due to the \namount of the Soldier’s body is in contact with the ground. The majority of \nthe firer’s frame is behind the rifle to assist with recoil management.  \n \nProne, unsupported. \n \nProne, supported. \n \nProne, roll-over. \n \nProne, reverse roll-over. \n6-35. Soldiers must practice the positions dry frequently to establish their natural point \nof aim for each position, and develop an understanding of the restrictive nature of their \nequipment during execution. With each dry repetition, the Soldier’s ability to change \npositions rapidly and correctly are developed, translating into efficient movement and \nconsistent stable firing positions. \n6-36.

Figure 6-12 \nshows the optimum unsupported kneeling position. The firer should be leaning slightly \nforward into the position to allow for recoil management and quicker follow-up shots. \nThe primary goal of this firing position is to establish the smallest wobble area possible. \nKey focus areas for kneeling, unsupported are: \n \nNonfiring elbow. Place the non-firing elbow directly underneath the rifle as \nmuch as possible. The elbow should be placed either in front of or behind the \nkneecap. Placing the elbow directly on the kneecap will cause it to roll and \nincreases the wobble area. \n \nLeg position. The non-firing leg should be bent approximately 90 degrees at \nthe knee and be directly under the rifle. The firing-side leg should be \nperpendicular to the nonfiring leg. The firer may rest their body weight on \nthe heel. Some firers lack the flexibility to do this and may have a gap \nbetween their buttocks and the heel. \n \nAggressive (stretch) kneeling. All weight on non-firing foot, thigh to calf, \nupper body leaning forward, nonfiring triceps on non-firing knee, firing leg \nstretched behind for support.

The kneeling supported position uses artificial support to steady the position (see \nfigure 6-13). Contact by the nonfiring hand and elbow with the artificial support is the \nprimary difference between the kneeling supported and unsupported positions since it \nassists in the stability of the weapon. Body contact is good, but the barrel of the rifle \nmust not touch the artificial support. Forward pressure is applied to aid in recoil \nmanagement. The key focus areas for the kneeling supported position are applied in the \nfollowing ways: \n \nNonfiring hand. The nonfiring hand will hold the hand guards firmly and \nwill also be pushed against the artificial support. Hand positioning will vary \ndepending on the type of support used.  \n \nNonfiring elbow. The nonfiring elbow and forearm may be used to assist \nwith the weapon’s stability by pushing against the artificial support.

    "page: 119, manual name: riflecarbine\n \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n7-1 \nChapter 7 \nAim \nThe functional element aim of the shot process is the continuous \nprocess of orienting the weapon correctly, aligning the sights, \naligning on the target, and the application of the appropriate lead \nand elevation during a target engagement. Aiming is a continuous \nprocess conducted through pre-shot, shot, and post-shot, to \neffectively apply lethal fires in a responsible manner with accuracy \nand precision. \nAiming is the application of perfectly aligned sights on a specific \npart of a target. Sight alignment is the first and most important part \nof this process. \nCOMMON ENGAGEMENTS \n7-1. \nThe aiming process for engaging stationary targets consist of the following \nSoldier actions, regardless of the optic, sight, or magnification used by the aiming \ndevice: \n \nWeapon orientation – the direction of the weapon as it is held in a stabilized \nmanner. \n \nSight alignment – the physical alignment of the aiming device: \n \nIron sight/back-up iron sight and the front sight post. \n \nOptic reticle. \n \nBallistic reticle (day or thermal). \n \nSight picture – the target as viewed through the line of sight. \n \nPoint of aim (POA) – the specific location where the line of sight intersects \nthe target. \n \nDesired point of impact (POI)–the desired location of the strike of the \nround to achieve the desired outcome (incapacitation or lethal strike). \n7-2. \nThe aim of the weapon is typically applied to the largest, most lethal area of any \ntarget presented. Sights can be placed on target by using battlesight zero (BZ), center of \nvisible mass (CoVM). The center of visible mass is the initial point of aim on a target of \nwhat can be seen by the Soldier. It does not include what the target size is expected or \nanticipated to be. For example, a target located behind a car exposes its head. The center \nof visible mass is in the center of the head, not the estimated location of the center of the \noverall target behind the car. \n \n \n\n",
    "page: 120, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 7 \n7-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nWEAPON ORIENTATION \n7-3. \nThe Soldier orients the weapon in the direction of the detected threat. Weapon \norientation includes both the horizontal plane (azimuth) and the vertical plane \n(elevation). Weapon orientation is complete once the sight and threat are in the Soldier’s \nfield of view.  \n \nHorizontal weapons orientation covers the frontal arc of the Soldier, \nspanning the area from the left shoulder, across the Soldier’s front, to the \narea across the right shoulder (see figure 7-1). \n \nFigure 7-1. Horizontal weapon orientation example \n \n \n\n\n[Image page_120_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram depicts a circular target area, labeled with numbers from 1 to 12 around the perimeter.

This is most \ncommonly applied in restricted, mountainous, or urban terrain where threats \npresent themselves in elevated or depressed firing positions (see figure 7-2). \n \nFigure 7-2. Vertical weapons orientation example \nSIGHT ALIGNMENT \n7-4. \nSight alignment is the relationship between the aiming device and the firer’s eye. \nThe process used by a Soldier depends on the aiming device employed with the weapon.  \n \nIron sight – the relationship between the front sight post, rear sight aperture, \nand the firer’s eye. The firer aligns the tip of the front sight post in the center \nof the rear aperture and his/or her eye. The firer will maintain focus on the \nfront sight post, simultaneously centering it in the rear aperture. \n \nOptics – the relationship between the reticle and the firer’s eye and includes \nthe appropriate eye relief, or distance of the Soldier’s eye from the optic \nitself. Ensure the red dot is visible in the CCO, or a full centered field of view \nis achieved with no shadow on magnified optics \n \nThermal – the relationship between the firer’s eye, the eyepiece, and the \nreticle. \n \nPointers / Illuminators / Lasers – the relationship between the firer’s eye, \nthe night vision device placement and focus, and the laser aiming point on \nthe target. \n\n\n[Image page_121_image_1.jpeg]: \n Disregard this image.",

Small changes matter - 1/1000 of an inch deviation at the weapon can \nresult in up to an 18 inch deviation at 300 meters.  \n7-5. \nThe human eye can only focus clearly on one object at a time. To achieve proper \nand effective aim, the focus of the firer’s eye needs to be on the front sight post or reticle \n(see figure 7-3). This provides the most accurate sight alignment for the shot process. \n \nFigure 7-3. Front sight post/reticle aim focus \n7-6. \nFirers achieve consistent sight alignment by resting the full weight of their head \non the stock in a manner that allows their dominant eye to look through the center of the \naiming or sighting device. If the firer’s head placement is subjected to change during the \nfiring process or between shots, the Soldier will experience difficultly achieving \naccurate shot groups. \n\n\n[Image page_122_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram from the military training manual includes the following information:\n\n1. **Top Section**:\n   - Instruction: \"Focus on the front sight post, not the target itself.\"\n   - Accompanying graphic: An icon depicting a front sight post.\n\n2. **Middle Section**:\n   - Instruction: \"Focus on the CCO aim point, not the target itself.\"\n   - Accompanying graphic: An icon with a CCO aim point.\n\n3. **Lower Section**:\n   - Instruction: \"Focus on the correct aim point along the bullet drop compensator.\"\n   - Accompanying graphic: A vertical line marking aim points, with indicators for '4' and '6'.\n\n4. **Bottom Section**:\n   - Instruction: \"There is no difference in focal viewing when using thermal optics.

    "page: 123, manual name: riflecarbine\nAim \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n7-5 \nSIGHT PICTURE \n7-7. \nThe sight picture is the placement of the aligned sights on the target itself. The \nSoldier must maintain sight alignment throughout the positioning of the sights. This is \nnot the same as sight alignment. \n7-8. There are two sight pictures used during the shot process; pre-shot and post-shot. \nSoldiers must remember the sight pictures of the shot to complete the overall shot \nprocess. \n \nPre-shot sight picture – encompasses the original point of aim, sight picture, \nand any holds for target or environmental conditions.  \n \nPost-shot sight picture – is what the Soldier must use as the point of reference \nfor any sight adjustments for any subsequent shot. \nPOINT OF AIM \n7-9. \nThe point on the target that is the continuation of the line created by sight \nalignment. The point of aim is a point of reference used to calculate any hold the Soldier \ndeems necessary to achieve the desired results of the round’s impact. \n7-10. For engagements against stationary targets, under 300 meters, with negligible \nwind, and a weapon that has a 200 meter or 300 meter confirmed zero, the point of aim \nshould be the center of visible mass of the target. The point of aim does not include \nANY hold-off or lead changes necessary.  \nDESIRED POINT OF IMPACT \n7-11. The desired point of impact is the location where the Soldier wants the projectile \nto strike the target. Typically, this is the center of visible mass. At any range different \nfrom the weapon’s zero distance, the Soldier’s desired point of impact and their point of \naim will not align. This requires the Soldier to determine the necessary hold-off to \nachieve the desired point of impact. \nCOMMON AIMING ERRORS \n7-12. Orienting and aiming a weapon correctly is a practiced skill. Through drills and \nrepetitions, Soldiers build the ability to repeat proper weapons orientation, sight \nalignment, and sight picture as a function of muscle memory. \n7-13. The most common aiming errors include: \n \nNon-dominant eye use – The Soldier gets the greatest amount of visual input \nfrom their dominant eye. Eye dominance varies Soldier to Soldier. Some \nSoldier’s dominant eye will be the opposite of the dominant hand. For \nexample, a Soldier who writes with his right hand and learns to shoot rifles \nright handed might learn that his dominant eye is the left eye. This is called \ncross-dominant. Soldiers with strong cross-dominant eyes should consider \nfiring using their dominant eye side while firing from their non-dominant \nhand side. Soldiers can be trained to fire from either side of the weapon, but \nmay not be able to shoot effectively using their nondominant eye. \n\n",
    "page: 124, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 7 \n7-6 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \n \nIncorrect zero – regardless of how well a Soldier aims, if the zero is \nincorrect, the round will not travel to the desired point of impact without \nadjustment with subsequent rounds (see appendix C of this publication). \n \nLight conditions – limited visibility conditions contribute to errors aligning \nthe sight, selecting the correct point of aim, or determining the appropriate \nhold. Soldiers may offset the effects of low light engagements with image \nintensifier (I2) optics, use of thermal optics, or the use of laser pointing \ndevices with I2 optics. \n \nBattlefield obscurants – smoke, debris, and haze are common conditions on \nthe battlefield that will disrupt the Soldier’s ability to correctly align their \nsights, select the proper point of aim, or determine the correct hold for a \nspecific target. \n \nIncorrect sight alignment – Soldiers may experience this error when failing \nto focus on the front sight post or reticle. \n \nIncorrect sight picture – occurs typically when the threat is in a concealed \nlocation, is moving, or sufficient winds between the shooter and target exist \nthat are not accounted for during the hold determination process. This failure \ndirectly impacts the Soldier’s ability to create and sustain the proper sight \npicture during the shot process. \n \nImproper range determination – will result in an improper hold at ranges \ngreater than the zeroed range for the weapon.  \nCOMPLEX ENGAGEMENTS \n7-14. A complex engagement includes any shot that cannot use the CoVM as the point \nof aim to ensure a target hit. Complex engagements require a Soldier to apply various \npoints of aim to successfully defeat the threat.  \n7-15. These engagements have an increased level of difficulty due to environmental, \ntarget, or shooter conditions that create a need for the firer to rapidly determine a ballistic \nsolution and apply that solution to the point of aim. Increased engagement difficulty is \ntypically characterized by one or more of the following conditions: \n \nTarget conditions: \n \nRange to target. \n \nMoving targets. \n \nOblique targets. \n \nEvasive targets. \n \nLimited exposure targets. \n \nEnvironmental conditions: \n \nWind. \n \nAngled firing. \n \nLimited visibility. \n \nShooter conditions: \n \nMoving firing position.\n\n",

Each of these firing conditions may require the Soldier to determine an \nappropriate aim point that is not the CoVM. This Soldier calculated aim point is called \nthe hold. During any complex engagement, the Soldier serves as the ballistic computer \nduring the shot process. The hold represents a refinement or alteration of the center of \nvisible mass point of aim at the target to counteract certain conditions during a complex \nengagement for— \n \nRange to target. \n \nLead for targets based on their direction and speed of movement.  \n \nCounter-rotation lead required when the Soldier is moving in the opposite \ndirection of the moving target. \n \nWind speed, direction, and duration between the shooter and the target at \nranges greater than 300 meters. \n \nGreatest lethal zone presented by the target to provide the most probable \npoint of impact to achieve immediate incapacitation. \n7-17. The Soldier will apply the appropriate aim (hold) based on the firing instances \npresented. Hold determinations will be discussed in two formats; immediate and \ndeliberate. \n7-18. All Soldiers must be familiar with the immediate hold determination methods. \nThey should be naturally applied when the engagement conditions require. These \ndeterminations are provided in “target form” measurements, based on a standard E-type \nsilhouette dimension, approximately 20 inches wide by 40 inches tall. \nIMMEDIATE HOLD DETERMINATION \n7-19. Immediate holds are based on the values of a “target form,” where the increments \nshown are sufficient for rapid target hits without ballistic computations. The immediate \nhold determinations are not as accurate as the deliberate method, and are used for \ncomplex target engagements at less than 300 meters. \n7-20.

    "page: 128, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 7 \n7-10 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nTARGET CONDITIONS \n7-24. Soldiers must consider several aspects of the target to apply the proper point of \naim on the target. The target’s posture, or how it is presenting itself to the shooter, \nconsists of— \n \nRange to target. \n \nNature of the target. \n \nNature of the terrain (surrounding the target). \nRANGE TO TARGET \n7-25. Rapidly determining an accurate range to target is critical to the success of the \nSoldier at mid and extended ranges. There are several range determination methods \nshooters should be confident in applying to determine the proper hold-off for pending \nengagements. There are two types of range determination methods, immediate and \ndeliberate.  \nImmediate Range Determination \n7-26. Immediate methods of range determination afford the shooter the most reliable \nmeans of determining the most accurate range to a given target. The immediate methods \ninclude— \n \nClose quarters engagements. \n \nLaser range finder. \n \nFront sight post method. \n \nRecognition method. \n \n100-meter unit-of-measure method. \nClose Quarters Engagements \n7-27. Short-range engagements are probable in close terrain (such as urban or jungle) \nwith engagement ranges typically less than 50 meters. Soldiers must be confident in \ntheir equipment, zero, and capabilities to defeat the threats encountered.  \n7-28. Employment skills include swift presentation and application of the shot process \n(such as quick acquisition of sight picture) to maintain overmatch. At close ranges, \nperfect sight alignment is not as critical to the accurate engagement of targets. The \nweapon is presented rapidly and the shot is fired with the front sight post placed roughly \ncenter mass on the desired target area. The front sight post must be in the rear sight \naperture. \nNote. If using iron sights when this type of engagement is anticipated, the \nlarge rear sight aperture (0-2) should be used to provide a wider field of view \nand detection of targets. \n\n",
    "page: 129, manual name: riflecarbine\nAim \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n7-11 \nLaser Range Finder \n7-29. Equipment like the AN/PSQ-23, STORM have an on-board laser range finder \nthat is accurate to within +/- 5 meters. Soldiers with the STORM attached can rapidly \ndetermine the most accurate range to target and apply the necessary hold-offs to ensure \nthe highest probability of incapacitation, particularly at extended ranges. \nFront Sight Post Method \n7-30. The area of the target that is covered by the front sight post of the rifle can be \nused to estimate range to the target. By comparing the appearance of the rifle front sight \npost on a target at known distances, your shooters can establish a mental reference point \nfor determining range at unknown distances. Because the apparent size of the target \nchanges as the distance to the target changes, the amount of the target that is covered by \nthe front sight post will vary depending upon its range. In addition, your shooter’s eye \nrelief and perception of the front sight post will also affect the amount of the target that \nis visible (see figure 7-6). \n \nLess Than 300 Meters. If the target is wider than the front sight post, you can \nassume that the target is less than 300 meters and can be engaged point of \naim/point of impact using your battle sight zero (BZO). \n \nGreater Than 300 Meters. The service rifle front sight post covers the width \nof a man's chest or body at approximately 300 meters. If the target is less \nthan the width of the front sight post, you should assume the target is in \nexcess of 300 meters. Therefore, your BZO cannot be used effectively. \n \nFigure 7-6. Front sight post method example \nRecognition Method \n7-31. When observing a target, the amount of detail seen at various ranges gives the \nshooter a solid indication of the range to target. Shooters should study and remember \nthe appearance of a person when they are standing at 100 meters increments. During \n\n\n[Image page_129_image_1.jpeg]: \n The image consists of two diagrams side by side, each illustrating different target scenarios related to range estimation in military training.\n\n1. **Left Diagram:**\n   - Shows a target that is wider than the front sight post.\n   - Text below states: \"TARGETS WIDER THAN THE FRONT SIGHT POST ARE TYPICALLY LESS THAN 300 METERS.\"\n\n2. **Right Diagram:**\n   - Displays a target that is covered by the front sight post.\n   - Text below reads: \"TARGETS THAT ARE COVERED BY THE FRONT SIGHT POST ARE TYPICALLY GREATER THAN 300 METERS.\"\n\nBoth diagrams emphasize a shooting principle related to target size and distance estimation.",
    "page: 130, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 7 \n7-12 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \ntraining, Soldiers should note the details of size and the characteristics of uniform and \nequipment for targets at those increments.  \n7-32. Once Soldiers are familiar and memorize the characteristics of standing threats at \n100 meter increments out to 500 meters, they should study the targets in a kneeling and \nthen in the prone position. By comparing the appearance of these positions at known \nranges from 100 meters to 500 meters, shooters can establish a series of mental images \nthat will help determine range on unfamiliar terrain. They should also study the \nappearance of other familiar objects such as weapons and vehicles.  \n \n100 meters – the target can be clearly observed in detail, and facial features \ncan be distinguished. \n \n200 meters – the target can be clearly observed, although there is a loss of \nfacial detail. The color of the skin and equipment is still identifiable. \n \n300 meters – the target has a clear body outline, face color usually remains \naccurate, but remaining details are blurred. \n \n400 meters – the body outline is clear, but remaining detail is blurred. \n \n500 meters – the body shape begins to taper at the ends. The head becomes \nindistinct from the shoulders. \n100-meter Unit-of-Measure Method \n7-33. To determine the total distance to the target using the 100 meter unit of measure \nmethod, shooters must visualize a distance of 100 meters (generally visualizing the \nlength of a football field) on the ground. Soldiers then estimate how many of these units \ncan fit between the shooter and the target. \n7-34. The greatest limitation of the unit of measure method is that its accuracy is \ndirectly related to how much of the terrain is visible. This is particularly true at greater \nranges. If a target appears at a range of 500 meters or more and only a portion of the \nground between your shooter and the target can be seen, it becomes difficult to use the \nunit of measure method of range estimation with accuracy. \n7-35. Proficiency in the unit of measure method requires constant practice. Throughout \ntraining, comparisons should be continually made between the range estimated by your \nshooter and the actual range as determined by pacing or other, more accurate \nmeasurement. \nImmediate hold for Range to Target \n7-36. Immediate range determination holds are based on the zero applied to the weapon. \nThe 300 meter zero is the Army standard and works in all tactical situations, including \nclose quarters combat. Figure 7-7, on page 7-13, shows the appropriate immediate holds \nfor range to target based on the weapon’s respective zero: \n \n \n \n\n",

The environment can complicate the shooter’s actions during the shot process \nwith excessive wind or requiring angled firing limited visibility conditions. Soldiers \nmust understand the methods to offset or compensate for these firing occasions, and be \nprepared to apply these skills to the shot process. This includes when multiple complex \nconditions compound the ballistic solution during the firing occasion.  \nWIND \n7-42. Wind is the most common variable and has the greatest effect on ballistic \ntrajectories, where it physically pushes the projectile during flight off the desired \ntrajectory (see appendix B of this publication). The effects of wind can be compensated \nfor by the shooter provided they understand how wind effects the projectile and the \nterminal point of impact. The elements of wind effects are— \n \nThe time the projectile is exposed to the wind (range). \n \nThe direction from which the wind is blowing. \n \nThe velocity of the wind on the projectile during flight. \nWind Direction and Value \n7-43. Winds from the left blow the projectile to the right, and winds from the right blow \nthe projectile to the left. The amount of the effect depends on the time of (projectile’s \nexposure) the wind speed and direction. To compensate for the wind, the firer must first \ndetermine the wind’s direction and value.  \n7-44. The clock system can be used to determine the direction and value of the wind \n(See figure 7-10 on page 7-17). Picture a clock with the firer oriented downrange \ntowards 12 o’clock.  \n7-45. Once the direction is determined, the value of the wind is next. The value of the \nwind is how much effect the wind will have on the projectile. Winds from certain \ndirections have less effect on projectiles. The chart below shows that winds from 2 to \n4°o’clock and 8 to 10 o’clock are considered full-value winds and will have the most \neffect on the projectile. Winds from 1, 5, 7, and 11 o’clock are considered half-value \nwinds and will have roughly half the effect of a full-value wind. Winds from 6 and \n12°o’clock are considered no-value winds and little or no effect on the projectile.  \nEXAMPLE \nA 10-mph (miles per hour) wind blowing from the 1 o’clock direction would \nbe a half-value wind and has the same effect as a 5 mph, full-value wind \non the projectile. \n \n \n \n\n",

The wind will push the projectile in the direction the wind is blowing (see \nfigure 7-11). The amount of effects on the projectile will depend on the time of exposure, \ndirection of the wind, and speed of the wind. To compensate for wind the Soldier uses a \nhold in the direction of the wind (into the wind). \n \n\n\n[Image page_135_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram features a circular clock system that illustrates the impact of wind on bullet trajectory. \n\n- **TOP SECTION**: \n  - There are arrows indicating the **\"DIRECTION OF WIND\"**. \n  - Text states: \n    - **\"WINDS FROM THE LEFT BLOW THE BULLETS TO THE RIGHT\"**\n    - **\"WINDS FROM THE RIGHT BLOW THE BULLETS TO THE LEFT\"**\n\n- **CENTER CIRCLE**: The circle is divided into twelve sections (like a clock).

Wind speeds can vary from the firing line to the target. Wind speed can be \ndetermined by taking an average of the winds blowing on the range. The firer’s focus \nshould be on the winds between the midrange point and the target. The wind at the one \nhalf to two thirds mark will have the most effect on the projectile since that is the point \nwhere most projectiles have lost a large portion of their velocity and are beginning to \ndestabilize. \n7-48.

Soldiers must be comfortable and confident in their ability to judge the effects of \nthe wind to consistently make accurate and precise shots. Soldiers will use wind \nindicators between the Soldier and the target that provide windage information to \ndevelop the proper compensation or hold-off.  \n7-52.

Using a hold involves changing the point of aim to compensate for the wind drift. \nFor example, if wind causes the bullet to drift 1/2 form to the left, the aiming point must \nbe moved 1/2 form to the right.

Firers must adjust their points of aim into the wind to compensate for its effects.\nIf they miss a distant target and wind is blowing from the right, they should aim to the\nright for the next shot. A guide for the initial adjustment is to split the front sight post\non the edge of the target facing the wind.\n7-55. Newly assigned Soldiers should aim at the target's center of visible mass for the\nfirst shot, and then adjust for wind when they are confident that wind caused the miss.\nExperienced firers should apply the appropriate hold for the first shot, but should follow\nthe basic rule—when in doubt, aim at the center of mass.\nLIMITED VISIBILITY \n7-56. Soldiers must be lethal at night and in limited visibility conditions, as well as\nduring the day. That lethality depends largely on whether Soldier can fire effectively\nwith today’s technology: night vision devices (NVDs), IR aiming devices, and TWSs.\n7-57. Limited visibility conditions may limit the viewable size of a threat, or cause\ntargets to be lost after acquisition. In these situations, Soldiers may choose to apply a\nhold for where a target is expected to be rather than wait for the target to present itself\nfor a more refined reticle lay or sight picture.\n7-58. Soldiers may switch between optics, thermals, and pointers to refine their point\nof aim. To rapidly switch between aiming devices during operations in limited visibility,\nthe Soldier must ensure accurate alignment, boresighting, and zeroing of all associated\nequipment. Confidence in the equipment is achieved through drills related to changing\nthe aiming device during engagements, executing repetitions with multiple pieces of\nequipment, and practicing nonstandard engagement techniques using multiple aiming\ndevices in tandem (IR pointer with NVDs, for example).\n\n",

A stable position assists in aiming and reduces unwanted movements \nduring trigger squeeze without inducing unnecessary movement or disturbing the sight \npicture. A smooth, consistent trigger squeeze, regardless of speed, allows the shot to fire \nat the Soldier’s moment of choosing. When both a solid position and a good trigger \nsqueeze are achieved, any induced shooting errors can be attributed to the aiming \nprocess for refinement.  \n8-6. \nSmooth trigger control is facilitated by placing the finger where it naturally lays \non the trigger. Natural placement of the finger on the trigger will allow for the best \nmechanical advantage when applying rearward pressure to the trigger. \n\n\n[Image page_140_image_1.jpeg]: \n Disregard this image.",

There is no specified point \non the trigger finger that must be used. It will not be the same for all Soldiers \ndue to different size hands. This allows the Soldier to engage the trigger in \nthe most effective manner \n \nTrigger squeeze – The Soldier pulls the trigger in a smooth consistent \nmanner adding pressure until the weapon fires. Regardless of the speed at \nwhich the Soldier is firing the trigger control will always be smooth. \n \nTrigger reset – It is important the Soldier retains focus on the sights while \nresetting the trigger. \n \nFigure 8-2.

    "page: 142, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 8 \n8-4 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nBREATHING CONTROL \n8-7. \nDuring the shot process, the shooter controls their breathing to reduce the amount \nof movement of the weapon. During training, the Soldier will learn a method of \nbreathing control that best suits their shooting style and preference. Breathing control is \nthe relationship of the respiratory process (free or under stress) and the decision to \nexecute the shot with trigger squeeze.  \n8-8. \nBreathing induces unavoidable body movement that contribute to wobble or the \narc of movement (AM) during the shot process. Soldiers cannot completely eliminate \nall motion during the shot process, but they can significantly reduce its effects through \npractice and technique. Firing on the natural pause is a common technique used during \ngrouping and zeroing.  \n8-9. \nVertical dispersion during grouping is most likely not caused by breathing but by \nfailure to maintain proper aiming and trigger control. Refer to appendix E of this \npublication for proper target analysis techniques. \nWORKSPACE MANAGEMENT \n8-10. The workspace is a spherical area, 12 to 18 inches in diameter centered on the \nSoldier’s chin and approximately 12 inches in front of their chin. The workspace is \nwhere the majority of weapons manipulations take place. (See figure 8-3 on page 8-5.) \n8-11. Conducting manipulations in the workspace allows the Soldier to keep his eyes \noriented towards a threat or his individual sector of fire while conducting critical \nweapons tasks that require hand and eye coordination. Use of the workspace creates \nefficiency of motion by minimizing the distance the weapon has to move between the \nfiring position to the workspace and return to the firing position.  \n8-12. Location of the workspace will change slightly in different firing positions. There \nare various techniques to use the workspace. Some examples are leaving the butt stock \nin the shoulder, tucking the butt stock under the armpit for added control of the weapon, \nor placing the butt stock in the crook of the elbow. \n8-13. Workspace management includes the Soldier’s ability to perform the following \nfunctions: \n \nSelector lever – to change the weapon’s status from safe to semiautomatic, \nto burst/automatic from any position. \nNote. Some models will have ambidextrous selectors.  \n Charging handle – to smoothly use the charging handle during operation. \nThis includes any corrective actions to overcome malfunctions, loading, \nunloading, or clearing procedures. \n Bolt catch – to operate the bolt catch mechanism on the weapon during \noperations. \n Ejection port – closing the ejection port cover to protect the bolt carrier \nassembly, ammunition, and chamber from external debris upon completion \n\n",
    "page: 143, manual name: riflecarbine\nControl \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n8-5 \nof an engagement. This includes observation of the ejection port area during \nmalfunctions and clearing procedures. \n Magazine catch – the smooth functioning of the magazine catch during \nreloading procedures, clearing procedures, or malfunction corrective actions. \n Chamber check – the sequence used to verify the status of the weapon’s \nchamber. \n Forward assist – the routine use of the forward assist assembly of the \nweapon during loading procedures or when correcting malfunctions. \n \nFigure 8-3. Workspace example \nCALLING THE SHOT \n8-14. Knowing precisely where the sights are when the weapon discharges is critical \nfor shot analysis. Errors such as flinching or jerking of the trigger can be seen in the \nsights before discharge. \n8-15. Calling a shot refers to a firer stating exactly where he thinks a single shot strikes \nby recalling the sights relationship to the target when the weapon fired. This is normally \nexpressed in clock direction and inches from the desired point of aim.  \n8-16. The shooter is responsible for the point of impact of every round fired from their \nweapon. This requires the Soldier to ensure the target area is clear of friendly and neutral \nactors, in front of and behind the target. Soldiers must also be aware of the environment \nthe target is positioned in, particularly in urban settings—friendly or neutral actors may \nbe present in other areas of a structure that the projectile can pass through. \n \n \n\n\n[Image page_143_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram from the military training manual depicts an individual handling a weapon with specific instructions and guidelines. Here are the details included in the image:\n\n1. **Main Instruction**: \n   - \"Weapon is 12-18 inches from the eyes.\"\n\n2. **Visual Representation**:\n   - The figure shows the individual holding a weapon oriented downrange. \n   - The buttstock is positioned at the inner elbow.\n   - The weapon is elevated to approximately 45 degrees.\n\n3. **Additional Instructions**:\n   - \"Weapon is rotated as necessary to complete required manipulations.\"\n\n4. **Workspace Manipulations** (listed on the right side):\n   - Charging Handle\n   - Bolt Catch\n   - Ejection Port\n   - Magazine Catch\n   - Chamber Check\n   - Forward Assist\n   - Selector Lever\n\nThis information provides a comprehensive overview of the safe handling and manipulation of the weapon as depicted in the diagram.",
    "page: 144, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 8 \n8-6 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nRATE OF FIRE \n8-17. The shooter must determine how to engage the threat with the weapon, on the \ncurrent shot as well as subsequent shots. Following the direction of the team leader, the \nSoldier controls the rate of fire to deliver consistent, lethal, and precise fires against the \nthreat. \nSLOW SEMIAUTOMATIC FIRE \n8-18. Slow semiautomatic fire is moderately paced at the discretion of the Soldier, \ntypically used in a training environment or a secure defensive position at approximately \n12 to 15 rounds per minute. All Soldiers learn the techniques of slow semiautomatic fire \nduring their introduction to the service rifle during initial entry training. This type of \nfiring provides the Soldier the most time to focus on the functional elements in the shot \nprocess and reinforces all previous training.  \nRAPID SEMIAUTOMATIC FIRE \n8-19. Rapid semiautomatic fire is approximately 45 rounds per minute and is typically \nused for multiple targets or combat scenarios where the Soldier does not have overmatch \nof the threat. Soldiers should be well-trained in all aspects of slow semiautomatic firing \nbefore attempting any rapid semiautomatic fire training.  \n8-20. Those who display a lack of knowledge of employment skills should not advance \nto rapid semiautomatic fire training until these skills are learned and mastered.  \nAUTOMATIC OR BURST FIRE \n8-21. Automatic or burst fire is when the Soldier is required to provide suppressive fires \nwith accuracy, and the need for precise fires, although desired, is not as important. \nAutomatic or burst fires drastically decrease the probability of hit due to the rapid \nsuccession of recoil impulses and the inability of the Soldier to maintain proper sight \nalignment and sight picture on the target. \n8-22. Soldiers should be well-trained in all aspects of slow semiautomatic firing before \nattempting any automatic training.  \n \n \n\n",
    "page: 145, manual name: riflecarbine\nControl \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n8-7 \nFOLLOW-THROUGH \n8-23. Follow-through is the continued mental and physical application of the functional \nelements of the shot process after the shot has been fired. The firer’s head stays in contact \nwith the stock, the firing eye remains open, the trigger finger holds the trigger back \nthrough recoil and then lets off enough to reset the trigger, and the body position and \nbreathing remain steady. \n8-24. Follow-through consists of all actions controlled by the shooter after the bullet \nleaves the muzzle. It is required to complete the shot process. These actions are executed \nin a general sequence: \n Recoil management. This includes the bolt carrier group recoiling \ncompletely and returning to battery.  \n Recoil recovery. Returning to the same pre-shot position and reacquiring the \nsight picture. The shooter should have a good sight picture before and after \nthe shot.  \n Trigger/Sear reset. Once the ejection phase of the cycle of function is \ncomplete, the weapon initiates and completes the cocking phase. As part of \nthe cocking phase, all mechanical components associated with the trigger, \ndisconnect, and sear are reset. Any failures in the cocking phase indicate a \nweapon malfunction and require the shooter to take the appropriate action. \nThe shooter maintains trigger finger placement and releases pressure on the \ntrigger until the sear is reset, demonstrated by a metallic click. At this point \nthe sear is reset and the trigger pre-staged for a subsequent or supplemental \nengagement if needed. \n Sight picture adjustment. Counteracting the physical changes in the sight \npicture caused by recoil impulses and returning the sight picture onto the \ntarget aiming point. \n Engagement assessment. Once the sight picture returns to the original point \nof aim, the firer confirms the strike of the round, assesses the target’s state, \nand immediately selects one of the following courses of action: \n \nSubsequent engagement. The target requires additional (subsequent) \nrounds to achieve the desired target effect. The shooter starts the pre-\nshot process. \n \nSupplemental engagement. The shooter determines the desired target \neffect is achieved and another target may require servicing. The shooter \nstarts the pre-shot process. \n \nSector check. All threats have been adequately serviced to the desired \neffect. The shooter then checks his sector of responsibility for additional \nthreats as the tactical situation dictates. The unit’s SOP will dictate any \nvocal announcements required during the post-shot sequence. \n \nCorrect Malfunction. If the firer determines during the follow-through \nthat the weapon failed during one of the phases of the cycle of function, \nthey make the appropriate announcement to their team and immediately \nexecute corrective action. \n\n",
    "page: 146, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 8 \n8-8 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nMALFUNCTIONS \n8-25. When any weapon fails to complete any phase of the cycle of function correctly, \na malfunction has occurred. When a malfunction occurs, the Soldier’s priority remains \nto defeat the target as quickly as possible. The malfunction, Soldier capability, and \nsecondary weapon capability determine if, when, and how to transition to a secondary \nweapon system.  \n8-26. The Soldier controls which actions must be taken to ensure the target is defeated \nas quickly as possible based on secondary weapon availability and capability, and the \nlevel of threat presented by the range to target and its capability: \n Secondary weapon can defeat the threat. Soldier transitions to secondary \nweapon for the engagement. If no secondary weapon is available, announce \ntheir status to the small team, and move to a covered position to correct the \nmalfunction. \n \nSecondary weapon cannot defeat the threat. Soldiers quickly move to a \ncovered position, announce their status to the small team, and execute \ncorrective action. \n No secondary weapon. Soldiers quickly move to a covered position, \nannounce their status to the small team, and execute corrective action. \n8-27. The end state of any of corrective action is a properly functioning weapon. \nTypically, the phase where the malfunction occurred within the cycle of function \nidentifies the general problem that must be corrected. From a practical, combat \nperspective, malfunctions are recognized by their symptoms. Although some symptoms \ndo not specifically identify a single point of failure, they provide the best indication on \nwhich corrective action to apply. \n8-28. To overcome the malfunction, the Soldier must first avoid over analyzing the \nissue. The Soldier must train to execute corrective actions immediately without \nhesitation or investigation during combat conditions.  \n8-29. There are two general types of corrective action: \n \nImmediate action – simple, rapid actions or motions taken by the Soldier to \ncorrect basic disruptions in the cycle of function of the weapon. Immediate \naction is taken when a malfunction occurs such that the trigger is squeeze and \nthe hammer falls with an audible “click.” \n \nRemedial action – a skilled, technique that must be applied to a specific \nproblem or issue with the weapon that will not be corrected by taking \nimmediate action. Remedial action is taken when the cycle of function is \ninterrupted where the trigger is squeezed and either has little resistance during \nthe squeeze (“mush”) or the trigger cannot be squeezed. \n8-30. No single corrective action solution will resolve all or every malfunction. Soldiers \nneed to understand what failed to occur, as well as any specific sounds or actions of the \nweapon in order to apply the appropriate correction measures. \n\n",
    "page: 147, manual name: riflecarbine\nControl \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n8-9 \n8-31. Immediate action can correct rudimentary failures during the cycle of function: \n \nFailure to fire – is when a round is locked into the chamber, the weapon is \nready to fire, the select switch is placed on SEMI or BURST / AUTO, and \nthe trigger is squeezed, the hammer falls (audible click), and the weapon does \nnot fire. \n \nFailure to feed – is when the bolt carrier assembly is expected to move return \nback into battery but is prevented from moving all the way forward. A clear \ngap can be seen between the bolt carrier assembly and the forward edge of \nthe ejection port. This failure may cause a stove pipe or a double feed (see \nbelow). \n \nFailure to chamber – when the round is being fed into the chamber, but the \nbolt carrier assembly does not fully seat forward, failing to chamber the round \nand lock the bolt locking lugs with the barrel extension’s corresponding lugs. \n \nFailure to extract – when either automatically or manually, the extractor \nloses its grip on the cartridge case or the bolt seizes movement rearward \nduring extraction that leaves the cartridge case partially removed or fully \nseated. \n \nFailure to eject – occurs when, either automatically or manually, a cartridge \ncase is extracted from the chamber fully, but does not leave the upper receiver \nthrough the ejection port. \n8-32. Remedial action requires the Soldier to quickly identify one of four issues and \napply a specific technique to correct the malfunction. Remedial action is required to \ncorrect the following types of malfunctions or symptoms: \n \nImmediate action fails to correct symptom – when a malfunction occurred \nthat initiated the Soldier to execute immediate action and multiple attempts \nfailed to correct the malfunction. A minimum of two cycles of immediate \naction should have been completed; first, without a magazine change, and the \nsecond with a magazine change. \n \nStove pipe – can occur when either a feeding cartridge or an expended \ncartridge case is pushed sideways during the cycle of function causing that \ncasing to stop the forward movement of the bolt carrier assembly and lodge \nitself between the face of the bolt and the ejection port.  \n \nDouble feed – occurs when a round is chambered and not fired and a \nsubsequent round is being fed without the chamber being clear. \n \nBolt override – is when the bolt fails to push a new cartridge out of the \nmagazine during feeding or chambering, causing the bolt to ride on top of the \ncartridge. \n \nCharging handle impingement – when a round becomes stuck between the \nbolt assembly and the charging handle where the charging handle is not in \nthe forward, locked position.  \n8-33. Although there are other types of malfunctions or disruptions to the cycle of \nfunction, those listed above are the most common. Any other malfunction will require \nadditional time to determine the true point of failure and an appropriate remedy. \n\n",
    "page: 148, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 8 \n8-10\nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nNote. When malfunctions occur in combat, the Soldier must announce \nSTOPPAGE or another similar term to their small unit, quickly move to a \ncovered location, and correct the malfunction as rapidly as possible. If the \nthreat is too close to the Soldier or friendly forces, and the Soldier has a \nsecondary weapon, the Soldier should immediately transition to secondary to \ndefeat the target prior to correcting the malfunction. \nRULES FOR CORRECTING A MALFUNCTION \n8-34. To clear a malfunction, the Soldier must—\n\nApply Rule #1. Soldiers must remain coherent of their weapon and continue\nto treat their weapon as if it is loaded when correcting malfunctions.\n\nApply Rule #2. Soldiers must ensure the weapon’s orientation is appropriate\nfor the tactical situation and not flag other friendly forces when correcting\nmalfunctions.\n\nApply Rule #3. Take the trigger finger off the trigger, keep it straight along\nthe lower receiver placed outside of the trigger guard.\n\nDo not attempt to place the weapon on SAFE (unless otherwise noted).\nMost stoppages will not allow the weapon to be placed on safe because the\nsear has been released or the weapon is out of battery. Attempting to place\nthe weapon on SAFE will waste time and potentially damage the weapon.\n\nTreat the symptom. Each problem will have its own specific symptoms. By\nreacting to what the weapon is “telling” the Soldier, they will be able to\nquickly correct the malfunction.\n\nMaintain focus on the threat. The Soldier must keep their head and eyes\nlooking downrange at the threat, not at the weapon. If the initial corrective\naction fails to correct the malfunction, the Soldier must be able to quickly\nmove to the next most probable corrective action.\n\nLook last. Do not look and analyze the weapon to determine the cause of the\nmalfunction. Execute the drill that has the highest probability of correcting\nthe malfunction.\n\nCheck the weapon. Once the malfunction is clear and the threat is\neliminated, deliberately check the weapon when in a covered location for any\npotential issues or contributing factors that caused the malfunction and\ncorrect them.\n\n",
    "page: 149, manual name: riflecarbine\nControl \n31 August 2017 \nTC 3-22.9, C2 \n8-11 \nPerform Immediate Action \n8-35. To perform immediate action, the Soldier instinctively: \n \nHears the hammer fall with an audible “click.” \n \nTaps the bottom of the magazine firmly. \n \nRapidly pulls the charging handle and releases to extract / eject the previous \ncartridge and feed, chamber, and lock a new round. \n \nReassess by continuing the shot process. \nNote. If a malfunction continues to occur with the same symptoms, the \nSoldier will remove the magazine and insert a new loaded magazine, then \nrepeat the steps above. \nPerform Remedial Action \n8-36. To perform remedial action, the Soldier must have a clear understanding of where \nthe weapon failed during the cycle of function. Remedial action executed when one of \nthe following conditions exist: \n \nImmediate action does not work after two attempts. \n \nThe trigger refuses to be squeezed. \n \nThe trigger feels like “mush” when squeezed. \n8-37. When one of these three symptoms exist, the Soldier looks into the chamber area \nthrough the ejection port to quickly assess the type of malfunction. Once identified, the \nSoldier executes actions to “reduce” the symptom by removing the magazine and \nattempting to clear the weapon. Once complete, visually inspect the chamber area, bolt \nface, and charging handle. Then, complete the actions for the identified symptom: \n \nStove pipe – Grasp case and attempt to remove, cycle weapon and attempt to \nfire. If this fails, pull charging handle to the rear while holding case. \n \nDouble-feed - the Soldier must remove the magazine, clear the weapon, \nconfirm the chamber area is clear, secure a new loaded magazine into the \nmagazine well, and chamber and lock a round. \n \nBolt override – Remove magazine. Pull charging handle as far rearward as \npossible. Strike charging handle forward. If this fails, pull charging handle to \nthe rear a second time, use tool or finger to hold the bolt to the rear, sharply \nsend charging handle forward. \n \n \n\n",

Rapid and continuous firing of several magazines in sequence without cooling, \nwill severely elevate chamber temperatures. While unlikely this elevated temperature \nmay cause a malfunction known as a \"cook-off\". A “cook-off” may occur while the \nround is locked in the chamber, due to excessive heating of the ammunition. Or the rapid \nexposure to the cooler air outside of the chamber, due in part to the change in pressure.  \n8-40. If the Soldier determines that he has a potential “cook-off” situation he should \nleave the weapon directed at the target, or in a known safe direction, and follow proper \nweapons handling procedures, until the barrel of the weapon has had time to cool. If the \nchambered round has not been locked in the chamber for 10 seconds, it should be ejected \nas quickly as possible. If the length of time is questionable or known to be longer than \n10 seconds and it is tactically sound, the Soldier should follow the above procedures \nuntil the weapon is cooled. If it is necessary to remove the round before the weapon has \ntime to cool, the Soldier should do so with care as the ejected round may detonate due \nto rapid cooling in open air. \nWARNING \nAmmunition “cook-off” is not likely in well \nmaintained weapons used within normal training \nand combat parameters.  \nSoldiers and unit leadership need to consider the \ndangers of keeping rounds chambered in \nweapons that have elevated temperatures due to \nexcessive firing. Or clearing ammunition that has \nthe potential to cook-off when exposed to the \ncooler air outside of the chamber.  \nExposure to the colder air outside of the chamber \nhas the potential to cause the “cook-off” of \nammunition. Keeping ammunition chambered in \nseverely elevated temperatures also has the \npotential to cause the “cook-off” of ammunition.  \nNote.

A secondary weapon, such as a pistol, is the most efficient way to engage a target \nat close quarters when the primary weapon has malfunctioned. The Soldier controls \nwhich actions must be taken to ensure the target is defeated as quickly as possible based \non the threat presented. \n8-42.

    "page: 153, manual name: riflecarbine\n \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \n9-1 \nChapter 9 \nMovement \nThe movement functional element is the process of the Soldier \nmoving tactically during the engagement process. It includes the \nSoldier’s ability to move laterally, forward, diagonally, and in a \nretrograde manner while maintaining stabilization, appropriate aim, \nand control of the weapon. \nProper application of the shot process during movement is vital to \ncombat operations. The most complex engagements involve \nmovement of both Soldier and the adversary. The importance of \nsight alignment and trigger control are at their highest during \nmovement. The movement of the Solider degrades stability, the \nability to aim, and creates challenges to proper trigger control. \nMOVEMENT TECHNIQUES \n9-1. \nTactical movement of the Soldier is classified in two ways: vertical and \nhorizontal. Each require specific considerations to maintain and adequately apply the \nother functional elements during the shot process. \n9-2. \nVertical movements are those actions taken to change their firing posture or \nnegotiate terrain or obstacles while actively seeking, orienting on, or engaging threats. \nVertical movements include actions taken to— \n \nChange between any of the primary firing positions; standing, crouched, \nkneeling, sitting, or prone. \n \nNegotiate stairwells in urban environments. \n \nTravel across inclined or descending surfaces, obstacles, or terrain. \n9-3. \nHorizontal movements are actions taken to negotiate the battlefield while \nactively seeking, orienting on, or engaging threats. There are eight horizontal movement \ntechniques while maintaining weapon orientation on the threat— \n \nForward – movement in a direction directly toward the adversary. \n \nRetrograde – movement rearward, in a direction away from the threat while \nmaintaining weapon orientation on the threat. \n \nLateral right/left – lateral, diagonal, forward, or retrograde movement to \nthe right or left. \n \nTurning left/right/about – actions taken by the Soldier to change the \nweapon orientation left/right or to the rear, followed by the Soldier’s \ndirection of travel turning to the same orientation. \n\n",
    "page: 154, manual name: riflecarbine\nChapter 9 \n9-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nFORWARD MOVEMENT \n9-4. \nForward movement is continued progress in a direction toward the adversary or \nroute of march. This is the most basic form of movement during an engagement. \nTECHNIQUE \n9-5. \nDuring forward movement,— \n \nRoll the foot heel to toe to best provide a stable firing platform. \n \nShooting while moving should be very close to the natural walking gait and \ncome directly from the position obtained while stationary. \n \nKeep the weapon at the ready position. Always maintain awareness of the \nsurroundings, both to your left and right, at all times during movement. \n \nMaintain an aggressive position. \n \nThe feet should almost fall in line during movement. This straight-line \nmovement will reduce the arc of movement and visible “bouncing” of the \nsight picture.  \n \nKeep the muzzle of the weapon facing down range toward the expected or \ndetected threat. \n \nKeep the hips as stationary as possible. Use the upper body as a turret, \ntwisting at the waist, maintaining proper platform with the upper body. \nRETROGRADE MOVEMENT \n9-6. \nRetrograde movement is where the orientation of the weapon remains to the \nSoldier’s front while the Soldier methodically moves rearward. \nTECHNIQUE \n9-7. \nDuring retrograde movement, the Soldier should— \n \nTake only one or two steps that will open the distance or reposition the feet. \n \nPlace the feet in a toe to heel manner and drop the center body mass by \nconsciously bending the knees, using a reverse combat glide. \n \nMaintain situational awareness of team members, debris, and terrain. \n \nUse the knees as a shock absorber to steady the body movement to maintain \nthe stability of the upper body, stabilizing the rifle sight(s) on the target.  \n \nEnsure all movement is smooth and steady to maintain stability. \n \nBend forward at the waist to put as much mass as possible behind the weapon \nfor recoil management. \n \nKeep the muzzle oriented downrange toward the expected or detected threat. \n \nKeep the hips as stationary as possible. Use the upper body as a turret, \ntwisting at the waist, maintaining proper platform with the upper body. \n\n",

In the most extreme \ncases, the target will be offset 90 degrees or more from the direction of movement. \nTECHNIQUE \n9-9. During lateral movement, Soldiers should— \n \nPlace their feet heel to toe and drop their center mass by consciously bending \nthe knees. \n \nUse the knees as a shock absorber to steady the body movement to maintain \nthe stability of the upper body, stabilizing the rifle sight(s) on the target.  \n \nEnsure all movement is smooth and steady to maintain stability. \n \nBend forward at the waist to put as much mass as possible behind the weapon \nfor recoil management. \n \nRoll the foot, heel to toe, as you place the foot on the ground and lift it up \nagain to provide for the smoothest motion possible. \n \nKeep the weapon at the alert or ready carry. Do not aim in on the target until \nready to engage.  \n \nMaintain awareness of the surroundings, both to the left and right, at all times \nduring movement. \n \nTrigger control when moving is based on the wobble area. The Soldier shoots \nwhen the sights are most stable, not based on foot position.  \n \nKeep the muzzle of the weapon facing down range toward the threat. \n \nWhen moving, the placement of the feet should be heel to toe. \n \nDo not overstep or cross the feet, because this can decrease the Soldier’s \nbalance and center of gravity. \n \nKeep the hips as stationary as possible. Use the upper body as a turret, \ntwisting at the waist, maintaining proper platform with the upper body. \nNote. It is more difficult to engage adversaries to the firing side while moving \nlaterally. The twist required to achieve a full 90-degree offset requires proper \nrepetitive training. The basic concept of movement must be maintained, from \nfoot placement to platform. \nTwisting at the waist will not allow the weapon to be brought to a full \n90 degrees off the direction of travel, especially with nonadjustable butt \nstocks. The Soldier will need to drop the non-firing shoulder and roll the \nupper body toward the nonfiring side. This will cause the weapon and upper \nbody to cant at approximately a 45-degree angle, relieving some tension in \nthe abdominal region, allowing the Soldier to gain a few more degrees of \noffset. \n\n",

Turning movement are used to engage widely dispersed targets in the oblique and \non the flanks. Turning skills are just as valuable in a rapidly changing combat \nenvironment as firing on the move (such as lateral movement) skills are and should only \nbe used with the alert carry.  \n9-11. It does not matter which direction the Soldier is turning or which side is the \nSoldier’s strong side. The Soldier must maintain the weapon at an exaggerated low-alert \ncarry for the duration of the turn. \n9-12. Muzzle awareness must be maintained at all times. Ensure that the muzzle does \nnot begin to come up on target the body is completely turned toward the threat. \n9-13. When executing a turn to either side, the Soldier will— \n \nLook first. Turn head to the direction of the turn first.  \n \nWeapon follows the eyes. The Soldier moves the weapon smoothly to where \nthe eyes go. \n \nFollow with the body. The body will begin movement with the movement \nof the weapon. Soldiers finish the body movement smoothly to maintain the \nbest possible stability for the weapon.  \n \nMaintain situational awareness. The Soldier must be completely aware of \nthe surrounding terrain, particularly for tripping hazards. When necessary, \nSoldiers should visually check their surroundings during the turning action \nand return their vision to the target area as quickly as possible. \n \n \n\n",
    "page: 157, manual name: riflecarbine\n \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nA-1 \nAppendix A \nAmmunition \nAppendix A discusses the characteristics and capabilities of the \ndifferent ammunition available for the M4- and M16-series \nweapons. It also includes general ammunition information such as \npackaging, standard and North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n(NATO) marking conventions, the components of ammunition, and \ngeneral principles of operation. The information within this \nappendix is 5.56mm for the M4- and M16-series weapons only. \nSMALL ARMS AMMUNITION CARTRIDGES \nA-1. Ammunition for use in rifles and carbines is described as a cartridge. A small \narms cartridge (see figure A-1) is an assembly consisting of a cartridge case, a primer, a \nquantity of propellant, and a bullet. The following terminology describe the general \ncomponents of all small arms ammunition (SAA) cartridges: \n \nCartridge case. The cartridge case is a brass, rimless, center-fire case that \nprovides a means to hold the other components of the cartridge. \n \nPropellant. The propellant (or powder) provides the energy to propel the \nprojectile through the barrel and downrange towards a target through \ncombustion. \n \nPrimer. The primer is a small explosive charge that provides an ignition \nsource for the propellant. \n \nBullet. The bullet or projectile is the only component that travels to the target. \nNote. Dummy cartridges are composed of a cartridge case and bullet, with no \nprimer or propellant. Some dummy cartridges contain inert granular materials \nto simulate the weight and balance of live cartridges. \n \n \nFigure A-1. Small arms ammunition cartridges \n\n\n[Image page_157_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram depicts a cartridge with several labeled components:\n\n1. **PRIMER**: Located at one end of the cartridge, it's a small metal cap that initiates the firing process when struck by the firing pin.\n\n2. **PROPELLANT**: This section is illustrated within the cartridge case and contains the explosive material that propels the bullet when ignited.\n\n3. **BULLET**: Found at the opposite end of the primer, this is the projectile that is fired from the weapon.\n\n4. **CARTRIDGE CASE**: Although not labeled as a separate part, it encompasses the primer, propellant, and bullet, forming the complete ammunition unit. \n\nThe components work together in the firing process of the ammunition.",
    "page: 158, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix A \nA-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nA-2. There are multiple types of bullets used for various purposes. These include ball, \ntracer, armor-piercing, blank, special ball long range (LR), dummy, and short range \ntraining. \nA-3. The cartridge case is made of steel, aluminum, or a brass combination (70 percent \ncopper and 30 percent zinc) for military use. The M4- and M16-series weapons is a \nrimless cartridge case that provides an extraction groove (shown in figure A-2). These \ncartridge cases are designed to support center-fire operation. \nA-4. Center-fire cases have a centrally located primer well/pocket in the base of the \ncase, which separates the primer from the propellant in the cartridge case. These cases \nare designed to withstand pressures generated during firing and are used for most small \narms. \nA-5. All 5.56mm ammunition uses the rimless cartridge case. A rimless cartridge is \nwhere the rim diameter is the same as the case body, and uses an extractor groove to \nfacilitate the cycle of functioning. This design allows for the stacking of multiple \ncartridges in a magazine. \nA-6. When the round is fired, the cartridge case assists in containing the burning \npropellant by expanding the cartridge case tightly to the chamber walls to provide rear \nobturation. \n \nFigure A-2. Cartridge case \n \n \n \n\n\n[Image page_158_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram depicts a cartridge case with several labeled components. Key features include:\n\n- **RIM**: Located at the base of the cartridge.\n- **EXTRACTION GROOVE**: Positioned just above the rim, facilitating the extraction of the cartridge from the chamber.\n- **RIM DIAMETER IS THE SAME AS THE CASE BODY**: A highlighted note indicating that the diameter of the rim matches that of the body of the cartridge.\n\nThe overall shape of the object is cylindrical.",
    "page: 159, manual name: riflecarbine\nAmmunition \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nA-3 \nPROPELLANT \nA-7. Cartridges are loaded with various propellant weights that impart sufficient \nvelocity, within safe pressure, to obtain the required ballistic projectile performance. \nThe propellants are either a single-base (nitrocellulose) or double-base (nitrocellulose \nand nitroglycerine) composition.  \nA-8. The propellant (see figure A-3) may be a single-cylindrical or multiple-\nperforation, a ball, or a flake design to facilitate rapid burning. Most propellants are \ncoated to assist the control of the combustion rate. A final graphite coating facilitates \npropellant flow and eliminates static electricity in loading the cartridge. \n \nFigure A-3. Propellant \n \n \n\n\n[Image page_159_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram illustrates a cross-section of a bullet cartridge. In the image, a cylindrical cartridge casing is shown, which contains a propellant. \n\n- The propellant is labeled and indicated with an arrow pointing to a dark, granular substance within the casing. \n- The front of the cartridge is tapered and leads to the bullet tip.\n\nThis representation is commonly used to explain the components of a cartridge used in firearms.",
    "page: 160, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix A \nA-4 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nPRIMER \nA-9. Center-fire small arms cartridges contain a percussion primer assembly. The \nassembly consists of a brass or gilding metal cup (see figure A-4). The cup contains a \npellet of sensitive explosive material secured by a paper disk and a brass anvil.  \nA-10. The weapon firing pin striking the center of the primer cup base compresses the \nprimer composition between the cup and the anvil. This causes the composition to \nexplode. Holes or vents located in the anvil or closure cup allow the flame to pass \nthrough the primer vent, igniting the propellant. \n \nFigure A-4. 5.56mm primer detail \n \n \n\n\n[Image page_160_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram illustrates the components of a cartridge primer. The key elements identified in the image are:\n\n1. **Primer Cup**: The part that houses the primer composition and is struck by the firing pin.\n2. **Anvil**: Positioned inside the primer cup, it aids in igniting the primer composition when the cup is struck.\n3. **Primer Composition**: The explosive material that ignites and initiates the bullet's firing.\n4. **Paper Disk (Foil)**: A layer that seals the primer composition within the cup.\n\nBelow the primer components, there is a depiction of a bullet cartridge, showing its overall structure, including the primer at the base.",
    "page: 161, manual name: riflecarbine\nAmmunition \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nA-5 \nBULLET \nA-11. The bullet is a cylindrically shaped lead or alloy projectile that engages with the \nrifling of the barrel. Newer projectiles consist of a copper slug with exposed steel \npenetrator, as with the M855A1. The bullets used today are either lead (lead alloy), or \nassemblies of a jacket and a lead or steel core penetrator. The lead used in lead-alloy \nbullets is combined with tin, antimony or both for bullet hardness. The alloying reduces \nbarrel leading and helps prevent the bullet from striping (jumping) the rifling during \nfiring.  \nA-12. Jacketed bullets (see figure A-5) are used to obtain high velocities and are better \nsuited for semiautomatic and automatic weapons. A bullet jacket may be either gilding \nmetal, gilding metal-clad steel, or copper plated steel. In addition to a lead or steel core, \nthey may contain other components or chemicals that provide a terminal ballistic \ncharacteristic for the bullet type.  \nA-13. Some projectiles may be manufactured from plastic, wax, or plastic binder and \nmetal powder, two or more metal powders, or various combinations based on the \ncartridge’s use. \n \nFigure A-5. Bullet example, Armor-piercing cartridge \n \n \n\n\n[Image page_161_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram depicts the different components of a bullet, which are labeled as follows:\n\n1. **Base Filler**: Located at the rear of the bullet, it likely serves to provide weight and balance.\n2. **Core**: This is the main part of the bullet, typically made of a dense material to ensure penetration and stopping power.\n3. **Bullet Jacket**: Surrounding the core, this component is usually made of a metal that helps to protect the core and enhance durability during flight.\n4. **Point Filler**: Positioned at the tip of the bullet, this may contribute to aerodynamic properties and expansion upon impact.\n\nThese elements together make up the structure of the bullet, influencing its performance and effectiveness in military applications.",
    "page: 162, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix A \nA-6\nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nSMALL ARMS AMMUNITION TYPES \nA-14. There are seven types of SAA for the M4- and M16-series weapons that are used\nfor training and combat. Each of these ammunition types provides a different capability\nand have specific characteristics. The following are the most common types of\nammunition for the rifle and carbine:\nBALL \nA-15. The ball cartridge (see figure A-6) is intended for use in rifles and carbines against\npersonnel and unarmored targets. The bullet, as designed for general purpose combat\nand training requirements, normally consists of a metal jacket and a lead slug.\nFigure A-6. Ball cartridge \nTRACER (TCR OR T) \nA-16. A tracer round contains a pyrotechnic composition in the base of the bullet to\npermit visible observation of the bullet’s in-flight path or trajectory and point of impact.\n(See figure A-7) The pyrotechnic composition is ignited by the propellant when the\nround is fired, emitting a bright flame visible by the firer. Tracer rounds may also be\nused to pinpoint enemy targets to ignite flammable materials and for signaling purposes.\nFigure A-7. Ball with tracer cartridge \n\n\n[Image page_162_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram illustrates a cross-sectional view of a bullet, highlighting two main components:\n\n1. **Bullet Jacket**: This is the outer casing of the bullet, depicted at the top of the image. It is typically made of a harder metal and serves to protect the softer lead core from deformation during firing.\n\n2. **Lead Slug**: Shown in the lower part of the image, the lead slug is the core of the bullet that is responsible for delivering the projectile's stopping power upon impact.\n\nThe diagram effectively demonstrates the relationship between the bullet jacket and lead slug in ammunition design.\n[Image page_162_image_2.jpeg]: \n This diagram illustrates the components of a bullet, specifically showing a cutaway view. The labeled parts include:\n\n- **Closure Cup**: Positioned at the top, it is part of the bullet's structure.\n- **Bullet Jacket**: Surrounding the main body of the bullet, providing protection to internal components.\n- **Point Filler**: Located below the bullet jacket, contributing to the bullet's overall performance and function.\n- **Tracer Composition**: Shown beneath the closure cup, it indicates the element that allows the bullet to leave a visible trace.\n- **Sub-Igniter Composition**: Positioned below the tracer composition, playing a role in ignition.\n- **Igniter Composition**: The bottom layer, responsible for initiating the firing process.\n\nThe diagram provides a clear visual representation of the bullet's internal components and their arrangement.",

The armor-piercing cartridge (see figure A-8) is intended for use against \npersonnel and light armored and unarmored targets, concrete shelters, and similar bullet-\nresistant targets. The bullet consists of a metal jacket and a hardened steel-alloy core. In \naddition, it may have a lead base filler and/or a lead point filler. \n \nFigure A-8. Armor-piercing cartridge \nSHORT RANGE TRAINING AMMUNITION \nA-18. The short range training ammunition (SRTA) (see figure A-9) cartridges are \ndesigned for target practice where the maximum range is reduced for training purposes. \nThis cartridge ballistically matches the ball cartridge out to 300 meters, and rapidly \ndrops in velocity and accuracy. This allows for installations with restricted training \nrange facilities to continue to operate with accurate munitions. This cartridge is also a \npreferred round when conducting training in a close quarters environment, like a shoot \nhouse or other enclosed training facility. \n \nFigure A-9.

The blank cartridge (see figure A-10) is distinguished by the absence of a bullet \nor projectile. It is used for simulated fire, in training maneuvers, and for ceremonial \npurposes. These rounds consist of a roll crimp (knurl) or cannelure on the body of the \ncase, which holds a paper wad in place instead of a projectile. Newer cartridges have \nrosette crimp (7 petals) and an identification knurl on the cartridge case. \n \nFigure A-10. Blank cartridge \nCLOSE COMBAT MISSION CAPABILITY KIT \nA-20. The close combat mission capability kit (CCMCK) cartridge (see figure A-11) is \nused for training purposes only.  \nA-21. The M4 carbine/M16 rifle conversion adapter kit provides utmost safety, in-\nservice reliability and maintainability. The kit is easy to install with a simple exchange \nof the bolt. It adapts the host weapon to fire unlinked 5.56mm M1042 man-marking \nammunition with the feel and function of live ammunition. The kit includes fail-safe \nmeasures to prevent the discharge of a standard “live” round. \n \nFigure A-11.

The dummy cartridge (see figure A-12) is used for practice in loading weapons \nand simulated firing to detect errors in employment skills when firing weapons. This \nround is completely inert and consists only of an empty cartridge case and ball bullet. \nCartridge identification is by means of holes through the side of the case or longitudinal \ncorrugations in the case and by the empty primer pocket. \n \nFigure A-12. Dummy cartridge \nCOLORS, MARKINGS, AND SYMBOLS \nA-23. Small arms ammunition is identifiable by color coding specification per type and \nintended use. Table A-1 describes the general color codes for all types of 5.56mm small \narms ammunition. Table A-2 identifies the color code specifications that are applied to \nthe tip of 5.56mm ammunition. \nA-24. Markings stenciled or stamped on munitions or their containers include all \ninformation needed for complete identification.  \nA-25. Packaging and containers for small arms ammunition are clearly marked with \nstandard NATO symbols identifying the contents of the package by type of ammunition, \nprimary use, and packaging information. The most common NATO symbols are \ndescribed according to Standardization Agreement (STANAG) (see table A-2 on page \nA-11). \nA-26. Small arms ammunition (less than 20mm) is not color-coded under \nMIL-STD-709D. Marking standards for small arms ammunition are outlined in— \n \nTM 9-1305-201-20&P. \n \nTM 9-1300-200. \nA-27.

The profession of arms requires Soldiers to \nunderstand their weapons, how they operate, their functioning, and \ntheir employment.  \nB-1. The flight path of a bullet includes three stages: the travel down the barrel, the\npath through the air to the target, and the actions the bullet takes upon impact with the\ntarget. These stages are defined in separate categories of ballistics; internal, external,\nand terminal ballistics.\nINTERNAL BALLISTICS \nB-2. Internal ballistics – is the study of the propulsion of a projectile. Internal\nballistics begin from the time the firing pin strikes the primer to the time the bullet leaves\nthe muzzle. Once the primer is struck the priming charge ignites the propellant. The\nexpanding gases caused by the burning propellant create pressures which push the bullet\ndown the barrel. The bullet engages the lands and grooves (rifling) imparting a spin on\nthe bullet that facilitates stabilization of the projectile during flight. Internal ballistics\nends at shot exit, where the bullet leaves the muzzle. (See figure B-1.)\n\n",

Several key terms are used when discussing the physical actions of internal \nballistics — \n \nBore – the interior portion of the barrel forward of the chamber. \n \nChamber – the part of the barrel that accepts the ammunition for firing. \n \nGrain (gr) – a unit of measurement of either a bullet or a projectile. There \nare 7000 grains in a pound, or 437.5 grains per ounce. \n \nPressure – the force developed by the expanding gasses generated by the \ncombustion (burning) of the propellant. Pressure is measure in pounds per \nsquare inch (psi). \n \nShoulder – the area of the chamber that contains the shoulder, forcing the \ncartridge and projectile into the entrance of the bore at the throat of the barrel. \n \nMuzzle – the end of the barrel.  \n \nThroat – the entrance to the barrel from the chamber. Where the projectile \nis introduced to the lands and grooves within the barrel. \n\n\n[Image page_178_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram depicts a cross-section of a firearm barrel, labeling key components involved in the bullet's travel and engraving process. \n\n- **Projectile**: The bullet that travels through the barrel.\n- **Bore**: The interior channel of the barrel through which the projectile moves.\n- **Chamber**: The area where the cartridge is seated before firing.\n- **Throat**: The section where the bullet begins to engrave as it enters the rifled part of the barrel.\n- **Shoulder**: A transition point in the barrel design.\n- **Forward Oburation**: Refers to the seal created by the bullet as it moves forward in the barrel.\n- **Rear Oburation**: The seal at the back of the bullet as it is propelled forward.\n- **Expanding Gas**: The gas generated from the fired cartridge that is contained between the forward and rear obturators.\n- **Bore Diameter Caliber**: The diameter measurement of the bore, indicating the caliber of the firearm.\n\nAdditionally, there's a note stating: \"Bullet engraving occurs when the projectile enters the throat and is engraved by the lands and grooves of the barrel rifling.\"",
    "page: 179, manual name: riflecarbine\nBallistics \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nB-3 \nEXTERNAL BALLISTICS \nB-4. External ballistics is the study of the physical actions and effects of gravity, drag, \nand wind along the projectile’s flight to the target. It includes only those general physical \nactions that cause the greatest change to the flight of a projectile. (See figure B-2.) \nExternal ballistics begins at shot exit and continues through the moment the projectile \nstrikes the target. \n \nFigure B-2. External ballistic terms \nB-5. The following terms and definitions are used to describe the actions or reactions \nof the projectile during flight. This terminology is standard when dealing with any \nweapon or weapon system, regardless of caliber. (See figure B-3.)  \n \nAxis of the bore (Line of Bore) – the line passing through the center of the \nbore or barrel. \n \nLine of sight (LOS) or gun target line (GTL) – a straight line between the \nsights or optics and the target. This is never the same as the axis of the bore. \nThe LOS is what the Soldier sees through the sights and can be illustrated by \ndrawing an imaginary line from the firer’s eye through the rear and front \nsights out to infinity. The LOS is synonymous with the GTL when viewing \nthe relationship of the sights to a target. \n \nLine of elevation (LE) – the angle represented from the ground to the axis \nof the bore. \n \nBallistic trajectory – the path of a projectile when influenced only by \nexternal forces, such as gravity and atmospheric friction. \n \nMaximum ordinate – the maximum height the projectile will travel above \nthe line of sight on its path to the point of impact. \n \nTime of flight – the time taken for a specific projectile to reach a given \ndistance after firing. \n \n \n\n\n[Image page_179_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram illustrates various concepts related to the trajectory of a projectile fired from a firearm. Key elements in the diagram include:\n\n- **Axis of the Bore / Line of Elevation**: Represented by a solid line, it indicates the orientation of the firearm's barrel in relation to the horizontal plane.\n\n- **Line of Sight (LOS) or Gun Target Line (GTL)**: Illustrated with a dashed line, this represents the line from the shooter's eye to the target.\n\n- **Ballistic Trajectory (or Trajectory)**: Shown with a dotted line, it depicts the path that the projectile takes from the firearm to the target over time.\n\n- **Maximum Ordinate**: Labeled indicator showing the highest point of the projectile's path.\n\n- **Time of Flight**: A horizontal line at the bottom indicating the duration from when the projectile is fired until it reaches the target.\n\nThe firearm depicted is oriented towards the target, which is represented by a figure in the distance. The diagram emphasizes the differences between the bore axis, the line of sight, and the actual trajectory of the projectile.",
    "page: 180, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix B \nB-4 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \n \n \nFigure B-3. Trajectory \n \nJump – vertical jump in an upward and rearward direction caused by recoil. \nTypically, it is the angle, measured in mils, between the line of departure and \nthe line of elevation. \n \nLine of departure (LD) – the line the projectile is on at shot exit. \n \nMuzzle – the end of the barrel. \n \nMuzzle velocity or velocity – the velocity of the projectile measured at shot \nexit. Muzzle velocity decreases over time due to air resistance. For small \narms ammunition, velocity (V) is represented in feet per second (f/s). \n \nTwist rate – the rotation of the projectile within the barrel of a rifled weapon \nbased on the distance to complete one revolution. The twist rate relates to the \nability to gyroscopically spin-stabilize a projectile on rifled barrels, \nimproving its aerodynamic stability and accuracy. The twist rate of the M4- \nor M16-series weapon is a right hand, one revolution in every seven inches \nof barrel length (or R 1:7 inches). \n \nShot exit – the moment the projectile clears the muzzle of the barrel, where \nthe bullet is not supported by the barrel. \n \nOscillation – the movement of the projectile in a circular pattern around its \naxis during flight. \n \nDrift – the lateral movement of a projectile during its flight caused by its \nrotation or spin. \n \nYaw – a deviation from stable flight by oscillation. This can be caused by \ncross wind or destabilization when the projectile enters or exits a transonic \nstage. \n \nGrain (gr) – a unit of measurement of either a bullet or a propellant charge. \nThere are 7000 grains in a pound, or 437.5 grains per ounce. \n \nPressure – the force developed by the expanding gases generated by the \ncombustion (burning) of the propellant. For small arms, pressure is measured \nin pounds per square inch (psi). \n \nGravity – the constant pressure of the earth on a projectile at a rate of about \n9.8 meters per second squared, regardless of the projectile’s weight, shape or \nvelocity. Commonly referred to as bullet drop, gravity causes the projectile \nto drop from the line of departure. Soldiers must understand the effects of \ngravity on the projectile when zeroing as well as how it applies to \ndetermining the appropriate hold-off at ranges beyond the zero distance. \n\n\n[Image page_180_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram illustrates the relationship between the line of bore, path of the bullet, and line of sight in a military context. \n\n- **Line of Bore**: Depicted as a straight line extending from the muzzle of the firearm, showing the direction in which the gun is aimed.\n- **Path of Bullet**: Illustrated as a curved dotted line indicating the bullet's trajectory after it leaves the firearm.\n- **Line of Sight**: Shown as a curved dashed line from the shooter's eye to the target, representing what the shooter can see.\n\nAdditionally, there is an image of a firearm on the left side, with a target represented on the right. The diagram emphasizes the differences between these lines and their significance in aiming and shooting accurately.",
    "page: 181, manual name: riflecarbine\nBallistics \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nB-5 \n \nDrag (air resistance) – the friction that slows the projectile down while \nmoving through the air. Drag begins immediately upon the projectile exiting \nthe barrel (shot exit). It slows the projectile’s velocity over time, and is most \npronounced at extended ranges. Each round has a ballistic coefficient (BC) \nthat is a measurement of the projectile’s ability to minimize the effects of air \nresistance (drag) during flight. \n \nTrajectory – the path of flight that the projectile takes upon shot exit over \ntime. For the purposes of this manual, the trajectory ends at the point of \nimpact. \n \nWind – has the greatest variable effect on ballistic trajectories. The effects \nof wind on a projectile are most noticeable in three key areas between half \nand two-thirds the distance to the target: \n \nTime (T) – the amount of time the projectile is exposed to the wind \nalong the trajectory. The greater the range to target, the greater time the \nprojectile is exposed to the wind’s effects.  \n \nDirection – the direction of the wind in relation to the axis of the bore. \nThis determines the direction of drift of the projectile that should be \ncompensated. \n \nVelocity (V) – the speed of the wind during the projectile’s trajectory to \nthe target. Variables in the overall wind velocity affecting a change to \nthe ballistic trajectory include sustained rate of the wind and gust spikes \nin velocity. \nTERMINAL BALLISTICS \nB-6. Terminal ballistics is the science of the actions of a projectile from the time it \nstrikes an object until it comes to rest (called terminal rest). This includes the terminal \neffects that take place against the target. \n \nKinetic Energy (EK) – a unit of measurement of the delivered force of a \nprojectile. Kinetic energy is the delivered energy that a projectile possesses \ndue to its mass and velocity at the time of impact. Kinetic energy is directly \nrelated to the penetration capability of a projectile against the target.  \n \nPenetration – the ability or act of a projectile to enter a target’s mass based \non its delivered kinetic energy. When a projectile strikes a target, the level of \npenetration into the target is termed the impact depth. The impact depth is the \ndistance from the point of impact to the moment the projectile stops at its \nterminal resting place. Ultimately, the projectile stops when it has transferred \nits momentum to an equal mass of the medium (or arresting medium).  \nB-7. Against any target, penetration is the most important terminal ballistic \nconsideration. Soldiers must be aware of the penetration capabilities of their ammunition \nagainst their target, and the most probable results of the terminal ballistics.  \nB-8. The 5.56mm projectile’s purpose is to focus the largest amount of momentum \n(energy) on the smallest possible area of the target to achieve the greatest penetration. \nThey are designed to resist deformation on impact to enter the target’s mass. The steel \n\n",
    "page: 182, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix B \nB-6 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \ntip of the penetrator allows for reduced deformation through light skin armor or body \narmor, and the heavier steel penetrator allows for increased soft tissue damage. \nACTIONS AFTER THE TRIGGER SQUEEZE \nB-9. Once the trigger is squeezed, the ballistic actions begin. Although not all \nammunition and weapons operate in the same manner, the following list describes the \ngeneral events that occur on the M4- and M16-series weapons when the trigger is \nsqueezed. \n \nThe hammer strikes the rear of the firing pin.  \n \nThe firing pin is pushed forward, striking the cartridge percussion primer \nassembly. \n \nThe primer is crushed, pushing the primer composition through the paper \ndisk, and on to the anvil, detonating the primer composition. \n \nThe burning primer composition is focused evenly through the primer cup \nvent hole, igniting the propellant. \n \nThe propellant burns evenly within the cartridge case. \n \nThe cartridge case wall expand from the pressure of the burning propellant, \nfirmly locking the case to the chamber walls.  \n \nThe expanded cartridge case, held firmly in place by the chamber walls and \nthe face of the bolt provide rear obturation, keeping the burning propellant \nand created expanding gasses in front of the cartridge case. \n \nThe projectile is forced by the expanding gasses firmly into the lands and \ngrooves at the throat of the bore, causing engraving.  \n \nEngraving causes the scoring of the softer outer jacket of the projectile with \nthe lands and grooves of the bore. This allows the projectile to spin at the \ntwist rate of the lands and grooves, and provides a forward obturation seal. \nThe forward obturation keeps the expanding gasses behind the projectile in \norder to push it down the length of the barrel. \n \nAs the propellant continues to burn, the gasses created continue to seek the \npath of least resistance. As the cartridge case is firmly seated and the \nprojectile is moveable, the gas continues to exert its force on the projectile. \n \nOnce the projectile passes the gas port on the top of the barrel, a small amount \nof gas is permitted to escape from propelling the projectile. This escaping gas \nis directed up through the gas port and rearward through the gas tube, \nfollowing the path of least resistance. The diameter of the gas port limits the \namount of gas allowed to escape. \n \nAs the end of the projectile leaves the muzzle, it is no longer supported by \nthe barrel itself. Shot exit occurs. \n \nUpon shot exit, most of the expanding and burning gasses move outward and \naround the projectile, causing the muzzle flash. \n \nAt shot exit, the projectile achieves its maximum muzzle velocity. From shot \nexit until the projectile impacts an object, the projectile loses velocity at a \nsteady rate due to air resistance. \n\n",

This rise and fall of the projectile \nis the trajectory. \n \nThe round achieves the highest point of its trajectory typically over half way \nto the target, depending on the range to target. The high point is called the \nround’s maximum ordinate or max ord. \n \nFrom the max ord, the projectile descends into the target. \n \nThe round strikes the target at the point of impact, which, depending on the \nfiring event, may or may not be the desired point of impact, and is seldom the \npoint of aim. \nNote. The point of aim and point of impact only occur twice during the \nbullet’s path to the target at distance; once when the trajectory crosses the \nline of sight approximately 25 meters from the muzzle, and again at the zero \ndistance (300 meters for the Army standard zero). \n \nOnce the projectile strikes a target or object, it delivers its kinetic energy \n(force) at the point of impact. \n \nTerminal ballistics begin. \nB-10. Once terminal ballistics begin, no bullets follow the same path or function. \nGenerally speaking, the projectile will penetrate objects where the delivered energy \n(mass times velocity squared, divided by 2) is greater than the mass, density, and area \nof the target at the point of the delivered force. There are other contributing factors, such \nas the angle of attack, yaw, oscillation, and other physical considerations that are not \nincluded in this ballistic discussion. \nSTRUCTURE PENETRATION \nB-11. The following common barriers in built-up areas can prevent penetration by a \n5.56-mm round fired at less than 50 meters (M855) including: \n \nSingle row sandbags. \n \nA 2-inch thick concrete wall (not reinforced with rebar or similar item). \n \nA 55-gallon drum filled with water or sand. \n \nA metal ammunition can filled with sand. \n \nA cinder block filled with sand (the block may shatter). \n \nA plate glass windowpane at a 45-degree angle (glass fragments will be \nthrown behind the glass). \n \nA brick veneer. \nNote. The M855A1 enhanced performance round (EPR) has increased \ncapabilities for barrier penetration compared with M855 as shown above.  \n\n",

Although most structural materials repel single 5.56-mm rounds, continued and \nconcentrated firing can breach (penetrate through) some typical urban structures. \nB-13. The best method for breaching a masonry wall is by firing short bursts in a \nU-shaped pattern. The distance from the firer to the wall should be minimized for best \nresults—ranges as close as 25 meters are relatively safe from ricochet.  \nB-14. Ball ammunition and armor-piercing rounds produce almost the same results, but \nare more likely to ricochet to the sides and rearward back at the firer (called spit-back).  \nNote. Soldiers must ensure the appropriate level of personal protective \nequipment is worn when conducting tactical and collective tasks, particularly \nat ranges less than 50 meters.  \nB-15. The 5.56-mm round can be used to create either a loophole (about 7 inches in \ndiameter) or a breach hole (large enough for a man to enter). When used against \nreinforced concrete, the M16 rifle and M249 cannot cut the reinforcing bars. \nSOFT TISSUE PENETRATION \nB-16. A gunshot wound, or ballistic trauma, is a form of physical damage sustained \nfrom the entry of a projectile. The degree of tissue disruption caused by a projectile is \nrelated to the size of the cavities created by the projectile as it passes through the target’s \ntissue. When striking a personnel target, there are two types of cavities created by the \nprojectile; permanent and temporary wound cavities. \nPermanent Wound Cavity \nB-17. The permanent cavity refers specifically to the physical hole left in the tissues of \nsoft targets by the pass-through of a projectile. It is the total volume of tissue crushed or \ndestroyed along the path of the projectile within the soft target. \nB-18. Depending on the soft tissue composition and density, the tissues are either elastic \nor rigid. Elastic organs stretch when penetrated, leaving a smaller wound cavity. Organs \nthat contain dense tissue, water, or blood are rigid, and can shatter from the force of the \nprojectile. When a rigid organ shatters from a penetrating bullet, it causes massive blood \nloss within a larger permanent wound cavity. Although typically fatal, striking these \norgans may not immediately incapacitate the target.  \nTemporary Wound Cavity \nB-19. The temporary wound cavity is an area that surrounds the permanent wound \ncavity. It is created by soft, elastic tissues as the projectile passes through the tissue at \ngreater than 2000 feet per second. The tissue around the permanent cavity is propelled \noutward (stretched) in an almost explosive manner from the path of the bullet. This \nforms a temporary recess or cavity 10 to 12 times the bullet’s diameter.  \nB-20. Tissue such as muscle, some organs, and blood vessels are very elastic and can \nbe stretched by the temporary cavity with little or no damage and have a tendency to \nabsorb the projectile’s energy. The temporary cavity created will slowly reduce in size \n\n",

Projectiles that do not exceed 2000 feet per second velocity on impact \ndo not provide sufficient force to cause a temporary cavity capable of \nincapacitating a threat. \nB-21. The extent of the cavitation (the bullet’s creation of the permanent and temporary \ncavities) is related to the characteristics of the projectile: \n \nKinetic energy (EK) – the delivered mass at a given velocity. Higher \ndelivered kinetic energy produces greater penetration and tissue damage. \n \nYaw – any yaw at the point of impact increases the projectiles surface area \nthat strikes the target, decreasing kinetic energy, but increasing the \npenetration and cavity size. \n \nDeformation – the physical changes of the projectile’s original shape and \ndesign due to the impact of the target. This increases the projectile’s surface \narea and the size of the cavity created after penetration. \n \nFragmentation – the fracturing of a projectile into multiple pieces or sub-\nprojectiles. The multiple paths of the fragmented sub-projectiles are \nunpredictable in size, velocity, and direction. The bullet jacket, and for some \ntypes of projectiles, the lead core, fracture creating small, jagged, sharp \nedged pieces that are propelled outward with the temporary cavity. \nFragments can sever tissue, causing large, seemingly explosive-type. Bone \nfragments caused by the bullet’s strike can have the same effect. \n \nTumbling – the inadvertent end-over-end rotation of the projectile. As a \nprojectile tumbles as it strikes the target, the bullet travels through the tissues \nwith a larger diameter. This causes a more severe permanent cavity as it \npasses through the soft tissue. A tumbling projectile can change direction \nerratically within the body due to its velocity and tendency to strike dense \nmaterial with a larger surface area.  \nB-22. Once inside the target, the projectile’s purpose is to destroy soft tissues with \nfragmentation. The ball ammunition is designed to not flatten or expand on impact, \nwhich would decrease velocity and delivered energy. For the M855-series cartridge, the \npenetrator tends to bend at the steel-core junction, fracture the weaker jacketed layer, \nand fragment into pieces when striking an object.  \n\n",
    "page: 186, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix B \nB-10 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nIncapacitation \nB-23. Incapacitation with direct fire is the act of ballistically depriving a target of the \nability, strength, or capability to continue its tactical mission. To assist in achieving the \nhighest probability of incapacitation with a single shot, the projectile is designed with \nthe ability to tumble, ricochet, or fragment after impact.  \nB-24. The projectile or its fragments then must hit a vital, blood-bearing organ or the \ncentral nervous system to effectively incapacitate the threat. The projectile’s limited \nfragmentation potential after entry maximizes the soft tissue damage and increases the \npotential for rapid incapacitation. \nLethal Zones \nB-25. The Soldier’s primary point of aim at any target by default is center of visible \nmass. This allows for a tolerance that includes the greatest margin of error with the \nhighest probability of a first round hit. The combat conditions may require more precise \nfires at partially exposed targets or targets that require immediate incapacitation.  \nB-26. Ideally, the point of aim is anywhere within a primary switch area. This point will \nmaximize the possibility of striking major organs and vessels, rendering a clean, one-\nshot kill (see figure B-4.) \n \n \n\n",

The head is the most frequently \nmoved body part and are the most difficult to hit with precision. Shots to other exposed \nbody parts, such as the pelvic area, should be considered for the shot.  \nB-28. Shots to the pelvic area are used when the target is not completely visible or when \nthe target is wearing body armor that prevents the Soldier from engaging the primary \nzone. This area is rich in large blood vessels and a shot here has a good possibility of \nimpeding enemy movement by destroying the pelvic or hitting the lower spine. \n \nCircuitry shots (switches).  \n \nHydraulic shots (timers).  \n\n\n[Image page_187_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram appears to be a representation related to a training manual, possibly illustrating a target or a device used in military training.

    "page: 188, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix B \nB-12 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nCircuitry Shots (Switches) \nB-29. Circuitry shots, or “switches,” are strikes to a target that deliver its immediate \nincapacitation. Immediate incapacitation is the sudden physical or mental inability to \ninitiate or complete any physical task. To accomplish this, the central nervous system \nmust be destroyed by hitting the brain or spinal column. All bodily functions and \nvoluntary actions cease when the brain is destroyed and if the spinal column is broken, \nall functions cease below the break. \nHydraulic Shots (Timer) \nB-30. Hydraulic shots, or “timers,” are impacts on a target where immediate \nincapacitation is not guaranteed. These types of ballistic trauma are termed “timers” as \nthat after the strike of the bullet, the damage caused requires time for the threat to have \nsufficient blood loss to render it incapacitated. Hydraulic shots, although ultimately \nlethal, allow for the threat to function in a reduced capacity for a period of time.  \nB-31. For hydraulic shots to eliminate the threat, they must cause a 40 percent loss of \nblood within the circulatory system. If the shots do not disrupt that flow at a rapid pace, \nthe target will be able to continue its mission. Once two (2) liters of blood are lost, the \ntarget will transition into hypovolemic shock and become incapacitated. \n \n \n\n",

It is designed for the advanced shooter; \nhowever, all Soldiers should be familiar with the contents of the \nappendix in order to build their mastery and proficiency with their \nindividual weapon. \nC-1. A complex engagement includes any shot that cannot use the CoVM as the point \nof aim to ensure a target hit. Complex engagements require a Soldier to apply various \npoints of aim (called hold, hold-off, or holds) to successfully defeat the threat.  \nC-2. This appendix builds upon the concepts discussed in Chapter 7, Aim, and only \ninclude topics specific to deliberate hold determinations. These topics are:  \n \nTarget conditions: \n \nRange to target. \n \nMoving targets. \n \nOblique targets. \n \nEnvironmental conditions: \n \nWind. \n \nAngled firing. \n \nCompound conditions: \nC-3. Each of these firing conditions may require the Soldier to determine an \nappropriate aim point that is not the CoVM. During any complex engagement, the \nSoldier serves as the ballistic computer during the shot process. The hold represents a \nrefinement or alteration of the center of visible mass point of aim at the target to \ncounteract certain conditions during a complex engagement for— \n \nRange to target. \n \nLead for targets based on their direction and speed of movement.  \n \nCounter-rotation lead required when the Soldier is moving in the opposite \ndirection of the moving target. \n \nWind speed, direction, and duration between the shooter and the target at \nranges greater than 300 meters. \n \nGreatest lethal zone presented by the target to provide the most probable point \nof impact to achieve immediate incapacitation. \nC-4.

Targets on any battlefield will not remain stationary for long periods of time, \nparticularly once a firefight begins. Soldiers must have the ability to deliver lethal fires \nat a variety of moving target types and be comfortable and confident in the engagement \ntechniques. There are two methods for defeating moving targets; tracking and trapping. \nTracking Method \nC-12. The tracking method is used for a moving target that is progressing at a steady \npace over a well-determined route. If a Soldier uses the tracking method, he tracks the \ntarget with the rifle’s sight while maintaining sight alignment and a point of aim on or \nahead of (leading) the target until the shot is fired.  \nC-13. When establishing a lead on a moving target, the rifle sights will not be centered \non the target and instead will be held on a lead in front of the target. The basic lead \nformula for moving targets that are generally perpendicular to the shooter (moving \nacross the sector of observation), is— \n \n𝟏\n𝟏𝟎𝟎𝑹(𝟕) = 𝑳  \n𝒐𝒓  \n𝟏\n𝟏𝟎𝟎𝑹𝒂𝒏𝒈𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝑻𝒂𝒓𝒈𝒆𝒕 𝒙 𝟕= 𝑳𝒆𝒂𝒅 𝒊𝒏 𝑰𝒏𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒔 \n \nC-14. This formula is used to determine the baseline lead in the direction of travel of \nthe target when its pace is approximately 3 mph or 4.5 feet per second (fps).

To execute the tracking method, a Soldier performs the following steps:  \n \nSwing the muzzle of the rifle through the target (from the rear of the target to \nthe front) to the desired lead (point of aim). The point of aim may be on the \ntarget or some point in front of the target depending upon the target's range, \nspeed, and angle of movement. \n \nTrack and maintain focus on the rifle’s sight while acquiring the desired sight \npicture. It may be necessary to shift the focus between the rifle’s sight and \nthe target while acquiring the sight picture, but the focus must be on the rifle’s \nsight when the shot is fired. Engage the target once the sight picture is \nacquired. While maintaining the proper lead,— \n \nFollow-through so the lead is maintained as the bullet exits the muzzle. \n \nContinue to track in case a second shot needs to be fired on the target. \nTrapping Method \nC-16. The trapping method (see figure C-6) is used when it is difficult to track the target \nwith the aiming device, as in the prone or sitting position. The lead required to \neffectively engage the target determines the engagement point and the appropriate hold-\noff.  \n\n\n[Image page_195_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram outlines the lead required for targeting a moving object at a moderate pace of 3 mph (4.5 fps). \n\n### Content Summary:\n\n#### Main Equation:\n- **Formula for lead in inches:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{100} \\times \\text{Range to Target} \\times 7 = \\text{Lead in inches}\n  \\]\n\n#### Target Range and Lead:\n- **400 m**: Lead = 28 inches\n- **300 m**: Lead = 21 inches\n- **200 m**: Lead = 14 inches\n- **100 m**: Lead = 7 inches\n\n#### Additional Information:\n- A table titled \"BASE LEAD\" illustrates the relationship between range to the target (R) and the corresponding lead (L) in inches:\n\n| Range to Target (m) | Lead (L) in inches |\n|----------------------|--------------------|\n| 100 m                | 7\"                 |\n| 200 m                | 14\"                |\n| 300 m                | 21\"                |\n| 400 m                | 28\"                |\n| 500 m                | 35\"                |\n\nThis helps in determining how to aim when firing at a moving target based on its distance.",

The effects of wind can be compensated for by the shooter provided they\nunderstand how wind effects the projectile and the terminal point of impact. The\nelements of wind effects are—\n\nThe time the projectile is exposed to the wind (range).\n\nThe direction from which the wind is blowing.\n\nThe velocity of the wind on the projectile during flight.\nWind Direction and Value \nC-22. Winds from the left cause an effect on the projectile to drift to the right, and winds\nfrom the right cause an effect on the projectile to drift to the left. The amount of the\neffect depends on the time of (projectile’s exposure) the wind speed and direction. To\ncompensate for the wind, the firer must first determine the wind’s direction and value.\n(See figure C-8 on page C-11.)\nC-23. The clock system can be used to determine the direction and value of the wind.\nPicture a clock with the firer oriented downrange towards 12 o’clock.\nC-24. Once the direction is determined, the value of the wind is next. The value of the\nwind is how much effect the wind will have on the projectile. Winds from certain\ndirections have less effect on projectiles. The chart below shows that winds from 2 to\n4°o’clock and 8 to 10 o’clock are considered full-value winds and will have the most\neffect on the projectile. Winds from 1, 5, 7, and 11 o’clock are considered half-value\nwinds and will have roughly half the effect of a full-value wind. Winds from 6 and\n12°o’clock are considered no-value winds and little or no effect on the projectile.\n\n",

Wind speed can be \ndetermined by taking an average of the winds blowing on the range. The firer’s focus \nshould be on the winds between the firer and the target. The front 1/3 of the trajectory \nplays the most significant role in determining the bullet’s wind drift deflection, but with \nincreasing range, the firer must consider the wind speed at midpoint and the target area \nto make the best overall assessment. \nC-27. The Soldier can observe the movement of items in the environment downrange \nto determine the speed. Each environment will have different vegetation that reacts \ndifferently.  \nC-28. Downrange wind indicators include the following: \n \n0 to 3 mph = Hardly felt, but smoke drifts. \n \n3 to 5 mph = Felt lightly on the face. \n \n5 to 8 mph = Keeps leaves in constant movement. \n \n8 to 12 mph = Raises dust and loose paper. \n \n12 to 15 mph = Causes small trees to sway. \nC-29. The wind blowing at the Soldiers location may not be the same as the wind \nblowing on the way to the target.  \nWind Estimation \nC-30. Soldiers must be comfortable and confident in their ability to judge the effects of \nthe wind to consistently make accurate and precise shots. Soldiers will use wind \nindicators between the Soldier and the target that provide windage information to \ndevelop the proper compensation or hold-off.  \nC-31. To estimate the effects of the wind on the shot, Soldiers need to determine three \nwindage factors: \n \nVelocity (speed). \n \nDirection. \n \nValue.  \nDetermining Wind Drift \nC-32. Once wind velocity, direction, and value have been determined, Soldiers \ndetermine how to compensate for the effects of wind. For the Soldier, there are three \nmethods of determining the appropriate hold-off to adjust for excessive wind; using the \nwind formula, wind estimation, or referencing a generalized ballistic windage chart. \nC-33. Once the range to target and wind speed are known, the formula below is used to \ndetermine drift. The output from the formula is in MOA. The final answer is rounded \noff to make the calculation quicker to perform. This formula (see figure C-10) will allow \nthe Soldier to adjust for the distance that the wind displaces his projectile.  \n \n \n\n",

The ballistics chart shows the wind drift in inches at ranges from 100 meters –\n300 meters and wind speeds up to 20 mph. The data from the 100-m (meter) line shows\nthat even in a 20-mph wind there is very little deflection of the round. At 300 meters, it\ncan be seen that the same 20-mph wind will blow the bullet 26 inches. This illustrates\nthe fact that the bullet is effected more by the wind the further it starts out from the\ntarget.\nWindage Hold \nC-35. Using a hold involves changing the point of aim to compensate for the wind drift.\nFor example, if wind causes the bullet to drift 12 inches to the left, the aiming point must\nbe moved 12 inches to the right.

The aiming point is center mass of the visual target, allowing for the \ngreatest possibility of impacting the target. The hold off is based on the \ndistance from center mass.

Firers must adjust their points of aim into the wind to compensate for its effects. \nIf they miss a distant target and wind is blowing from the right, they should aim to the \nright for the next shot. A guide for the initial adjustment is to split the front sight post \non the edge of the target facing the wind. \nC-37. Newly assigned Soldiers should aim at the target's center of visible mass for the \nfirst shot, and then adjust for wind when they are confident that wind caused the miss. \nExperienced firers should apply the appropriate hold-off for the first shot, but should \nfollow the basic rule—when in doubt, aim at the center of visible mass. \n \n \n\n\n[Image page_203_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram from the military training manual provides information on target engagement under specific conditions.

Rounds fired at \nexcessive angles at extended ranges beyond the weapon’s zero distance strike high on \nthe target. To compensate for this, firers can rapidly determine a correct firing solution \nusing the Quick High Angle Formula. \nC-39. The first step is to determine the appropriate hold for the range to target beyond \nzero distance.

The drill structure is standardized for all \nindividual and crew served weapons in order to reinforce the most \ncommon actions all Soldiers need to routinely execute with their \nassigned equipment during training and combat.  \nThese drills are used during Table III of the integrated weapons \ntraining strategy, as well as during routine maintenance, concurrent \ntraining, and during deployments. The drills found within this \nappendix are used to build and maintain skills needed to achieve \nproficiency and mastery of the weapon, and are to be ingrained into \ndaily use with the weapon. \nD-1. Each drill is designed to develop confidence in the equipment and Soldier actions \nduring training and combat operations. As they are reinforced through repetition, they \nbecome second nature to the Soldier, providing smooth, consistent employment during \nnormal and unusual conditions.  \nD-2. The drills provided are designed to build the Soldier’s proficiency with the \nfollowing principles: \n \nMindset – the Soldier’s ability to perform tasks quickly and effectively under \nstress. \n \nEfficiency – ensure the drills require the least amount of movement or steps \nto complete correctly. Make every step count. \n \nIndividual tactics – ensure the drills are directly linked to employment in \ncombat.  \n \nFlexibility – provide drills that are not rigid in execution. Units may alter the \nprocedural steps depending on their equipment, configuration, or tactical \nneed.  \nMINDSET \nD-3. Continuous combat is inherently stressful. It exhausts Soldiers and causes \nphysiological changes that reduce their ability to perform tasks as quickly or effectively \nas necessary. The Soldier’s ability to function under stress is the key to winning battles, \nsince, without the Soldier, weapons and tactics are useless. Individual and unit military \neffectiveness depend on the Soldier’s ability to think clearly, accurately, quickly, all \nwith initiative, motivation, physical strength, and endurance. \n\n",
    "page: 208, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix D \nD-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nD-4. The impact of physiological changes caused by the stress of combat escalates or \nde-escalates based on the degree of stimulation, causing Soldiers to attain different \nlevels of awareness as events occur in the continually transitioning operational area \naround them. Maintaining a tactical mindset involves understanding one’s level of \nawareness and transitioning between the levels of awareness as the situation requires \nescalation or de-escalation. \nNote. Stress can be countered using the principles associated with Soldier \nresilience and performance enhancement. The Comprehensive Soldier and \nFamily Fitness (CSF2) is designed to increase a Soldier’s ability and \nwillingness to perform an assigned task or mission and enhance his \nperformance by assessing and training mental resilience, physical resilience, \nand performance enhancement techniques and skills. This initiative \nintroduces many resources used to train Soldiers on skills to counter stress. \nFor more information about CSF2, see http://csf2.army.mil/. \nEFFICIENCY \nD-5. Efficiency is defined as the minimization of time or resources to produce a desired \noutcome. Efficient movements are naturally faster than movements that contain \nexcessive or wasteful actions.  \nD-6. By reducing the amount of effort, mental, and/or physical, the movement \nbecomes repeatable and the effect becomes predictable. This allows the Soldier to focus \non the tactics while still maintaining the ability to produce accurate and precise fires. \nINDIVIDUAL TACTICS \nD-7. Individual tactics are actions independent of unit standard operating procedures \n(SOPs) or situations that maximize the Soldier’s chance of survival and victory in a \nsmall arms, direct fire battle.  \nD-8. Examples of individual tactics include use of cover and standoff, or the \nmanipulation of time and space between a Soldier and his enemy. \nFLEXIBILITY \nD-9. The techniques presented in this publication are not meant to be prescriptive, as \nmultiple techniques can be used to achieve the same goal. In fact, there is no singular \n“one size fits all” solution to rifle fire; different types of enemies and scenarios require \nthe use of different techniques.  \nD-10. However, the techniques presented are efficient and proven techniques for \nconducting various rifle-related tasks. Should other techniques be selected, they should \nmeet the following criteria: \n\n",
    "page: 209, manual name: riflecarbine\nDrills \n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nD-3 \nRELIABLE UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS \nD-11. Techniques should be designed for reliability when it counts; during combat. The \ntechnique should produce the intended results without fail, under any conditions and \nwhile wearing mission-essential equipment. \nD-12. It should also be tested under as high stress conditions as allowed in training. \nREPEATABLE UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS \nD-13. As combat is a stressor, a Soldier’s body responds much as it does to any other \nstressful stimulus; physiological changes begin to occur, igniting a variable scale of \ncontrollable and uncontrollable responses based on the degree of stimulation.  \nD-14. The technique should support or exploit the body’s natural reaction to life-\nthreatening stress.  \nEFFICIENCY IN MOTION \nD-15. The technique should be designed to create the greatest degree of efficiency of \nmotion. It should contain only necessary movement. Excessive or unnecessary \nmovement in a fighting technique costs time to execute. In a violent encounter, time can \nmean the difference between life and death. \nD-16. Consider the speed at which violent encounters occur; An unarmed person can \ncover a distance of 20 feet in approximately 1 second. Efficiency decreases the time \nnecessary to complete a task, which enhances the Soldier’s safety. \nDEVELOP NATURAL RESPONSES THROUGH REPETITION \nD-17. When practiced correctly and in sufficient volume, the technique should build \nreflexive reactions that a Soldier applies in response to a set of conditions. Only with \ncorrect practice will a Soldier create the muscle memory necessary to serve him under \nconditions of dire stress. The goal is to create automaticity, the ability to perform an \naction without thinking through the steps associated with the action. \nLEVERAGE OVERMATCH CAPABILITIES \nD-18. Engagements can occur from 0 to 600 meters and any variance in between. Fast \nand efficient presentation of the rifle allows more time to stabilize the weapon, refine \nthe aim, and control the shot required to deliver precise fires. This rapidly moves the \nunit toward the goal of fire superiority and gains/maintains the initiative. Speed should \nbe developed throughout the training cycle and maintained during operations. \nD-19. As distance between the Soldier and a threat decreases, so does the time to engage \nwith well-place lethal fires. As distance increase, the Soldier gains time to refine his aim \nand conduct manipulations.  \n \n \n\n",

If also provides a fitment check between \nthe weapon, the Soldier’s load bearing equipment, and the Soldier’s ability to move \nbetween positions while maintaining effective use of the weapon. \nD-26. When conducting this drill, Soldiers should: \n \nVerify the proper adjustment to the sling. \n \nRotate the torso left and right to ensure the sling does not hang up on any \nequipment. \n \nEnsure the weapon does not interfere with tactical movement. \nDRILL C – EQUIPMENT CHECK \nD-27.

    "page: 215, manual name: riflecarbine\n13 May 2016 \nTC 3-22.9 \nE-1\nAppendix E \nZeroing \nZeroing a weapon is not a training exercise, nor is it combat skills \nevent. Zeroing is a maintenance procedure that is accomplished to \nplace the weapon in operation, based on the Soldier’s skill, \ncapabilities, tactical scenario, aiming device, and ammunition. Its \npurpose is to achieve the desired relationship between the line of \nsight and the trajectory of the round at a known distance. The \nzeroing process ensures the Soldier, weapon, aiming device, and \nammunition are performing as expected at a specific range to target \nwith the least amount of induced errors.  \nFor Soldiers to achieve a high level of accuracy and precision, it is \ncritical they zero their aiming device to their weapon correctly. The \nSoldier must first achieve a consistent grouping of a series of shots, \nthen align the mean point of impact of that grouping to the \nappropriate point of aim. Soldiers use the process described in this \nappendix with their weapon and equipment’s technical manuals to \ncomplete the zeroing task. \nBATTLESIGHT ZERO \nE-1. The term battlesight zero means the combination of sight settings and trajectory\nthat greatly reduces or eliminates the need for precise range estimation, further\neliminating sight adjustment, holdover or hold-under for the most likely engagements.\nThe battlesight zero is the default sight setting for a weapon, ammunition, and aiming\ndevice combination.\nE-2. An appropriate battlesight zero allows the firer to accurately engage targets out\nto a set distance without an adjusted aiming point. For aiming devices that are not\ndesigned to be adjusted in combat, or do not have a bullet drop compensator, such as the\nM68, the selection of the appropriate battlesight zero distance is critical.\nZEROING PROCESS \nE-3. A specific process should be followed when zeroing. The process is designed to\nbe time-efficient and will produce the most accurate zero possible.\nE-4. The zero process includes mechanical zero, laser borelight, 25-m grouping and\nzeroing, and zero confirmation out to 300 meters.\n\n",
    "page: 216, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix E  \nE-2 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nNote. Although wind and gravity have the greatest effect on the projectile’s \ntrajectory, air density and elevation must also be taken into consideration.  \nLASER BORELIGHT \nE-5. The borelight is an eye-safe laser that is used to boresight optics, iron sights, and \naiming lasers. The borelight assists the first shot group hitting the 25-m zeroing target \nwhen zeroing the weapon. Using the borelight will save range time and require less \nrounds for the zeroing process. Borelighting is done with a borelight, which is centered \nin the bore of the weapon, and with an offset target placed 10 meters from the muzzle \nof the weapon.  \n25-M GROUPING AND ZEROING \nE-6. After successfully boresighting the weapon, the next step is to perform grouping \nand zeroing exercises. Grouping and zeroing is done at 25 meters on a 25-m zero target \nor at known distance range.  \n25-M GROUPING \nE-7. The goal of the grouping exercise is for the shooter to fire tight shot groups and \nconsistently place those groups in the same location. Tight, consistently placed shot \ngroups show that the firer is applying proper aiming and smooth trigger control before \nstarting the zeroing process. The firer should not start the zeroing process until they have \ndemonstrated their ability to group well. \n25-M ZEROING \nE-8. Once the firer has shown their ability to accurately group, they should begin \nadjusting the aiming device to move the groups to the center of the target. During the \nzeroing process, the firer should attempt to center their groups as much as possible. \nDepending on the aiming device used, there may be a zero offset that needs to be used \nat 25 meters. During the zeroing process it is important that the firer adjusts their groups \nas close to the offset mark as possible. \nZERO CONFIRMATION OUT TO 300 METERS \nE-9. The most important step in the zeroing process is zero confirmation out to 300 \nmeters. Having a 25 m zero does not guarantee a center hit at 300 meters. The only way \nto rely on a 300-m hit, is to confirm a 300-m zero.  \nE-10. Confirmation can be done on any range where Soldiers can see the impacts of \ntheir rounds. Groups should be fired and aiming devices should be adjusted. At a \nminimum, the confirmation should be done at 300 meters. If rounds are available, groups \ncan be fired at various ranges to show the firers where their impact will be.  \nE-11. When confirming zero at ranges past 100 meters, the effects of the wind needs to \nbe considered and acted upon, if necessary. If a zero is confirmed at 300 meters on a \nwindy day, and then the weapon is fired at a later date in different wind conditions or no \nwind at all, the impact will change. (See figure E-1 on page E-3.) \n\n",

Feedback must be included in all live-fire training. Soldiers must have precise \nknowledge of a bullet strike; feedback is not adequate when bullets from previous firings \ncannot be identified. To provide accurate feedback, trainers ensure that Soldiers \ntriangulate and clearly mark previous shot groups on a zeroing target or receive a hard \ncopy from the tower on an automated range. \nE-13. After zeroing, downrange feedback should be conducted. If modified field fire or \nknown distance ranges are not available, a series of scaled silhouette targets can be used \nfor training on the 25-m range. \nE-14. With the M4- and M16-series of weapons, this range is 25 to 300 meters. This \nmeans, that with a properly zeroed rifle, the firer can aim center mass of a target between \n25 meters and 300 meters and effectively engage it. A properly trained rifleman should \nbe able to engage targets out to 600 meters in the right circumstances.  \n\n\n[Image page_217_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram consists of two sections comparing shooting results under different wind conditions:\n\n1. **Left Section: \"WIND\"**\n   - Title: \"Zeroing at 300 meters in windy conditions\"\n   - The target shows several black dots representing shots grouping, which appears to be shifted to the right of the center due to wind influence.\n\n2. **Right Section: \"NO WIND\"**\n   - Title: \"Shooting the next day with the same zero but with NO wind blowing\"\n   - This target displays a different grouping of black dots, which are concentrated more toward the center compared to the windy conditions, indicating better accuracy without wind interference.\n\nBoth sections feature a grid background with concentric circles depicting the target area.",
    "page: 218, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix E \nE-4\nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nNote. A common misconception is that wearing combat gear will cause the \nzero to change. Adding combat gear to the Soldier's body does not cause the \nsights or the reticle to move. The straight line between the center of the rear \nsight aperture and the tip of the front sight post either intersects with the \ntrajectory at the desired point, or it does not. Soldiers should be aware of their \nown performance, to include a tendency to pull their shots in a certain \ndirection, across various positions, and with or without combat gear. A shift \nin point of impact in one shooting position may not correspond to a shift in \nthe point of impact from a different shooting position.  \nE-15.

    "page: 221, manual name: riflecarbine\nZeroing \n31 August 2017 \nTC 3-22.9, C2 \nE-7 \nE-16. A good zero is necessary to be able to engage targets accurately. Whenever the \nSoldier deploys or does training in a new location, they should confirm the zero on their \nrifle if possible, as elevation, barometric pressure, and other factors will affect the \ntrajectory of a round. There are multitudes of factors that can affect a zero, and the only \nsure way to know where the rounds are going, is to fire the rifle to confirm. \nE-17. The zero on each assigned rifle WILL NOT transfer to another rifle. For example, \nif the windage zero on the Soldier’s iron sights was three minutes (3MOA) left of center, \nputting that same setting on another rifle does not make it zeroed. This is due to the \nmanufacturing difference between the weapons. \nE-18. It is recommended that Soldiers setup their equipment and dry practice in position \nwith gear on before coming to the range.  \nE-19. Standard in Training Commission (STRAC) Department of the Army Pamphlet \n(DA PAM) 350-38 allocates ammunition to conduct zeroing procedures using three-shot \ngroups. The preferred method is to use a five-shot grouping, allowing the firer to more \naccurately analyze their shot group. Figure E-4 shows similar three-shot and five-shot \ngroups with one shot on the right edge of the group. If all the shots were taken into \naccount in the three-shot group, the firer would probably adjust their zero from the right \nedge of the four-cm circle. It is possible that the shot on the right was a poor shot and \nshould not be counted in the group. The five-shot group on right is in the same place as \nthe one on the left with the exception of the one shot out to the right. With four out of \nfive shots in a tight group, the wide shot can be discounted and little or no change to the \nwindage is necessary. \nE-20. Part of the grouping and zeroing process is the marking and analysis of shot \ngroups. \n \nFigure E-4. Grouping \n\n\n[Image page_221_image_1.jpeg]: \n The image consists of two diagrams, each displaying a target with concentric circles and a grid background. \n\nOn the left side, labeled \"3 SHOT,\" there are two white dots and one black dot. The white dots form a diagonal line leading to the black dot. The positioning suggests a spread from the point of aim.\n\nOn the right side, labeled \"5 SHOT,\" there are multiple white dots clustered more tightly around a central point, signifying a tighter grouping of shots compared to the 3-shot diagram. The black dot remains in a similar position as on the left.\n\nOverall, the diagrams seem to illustrate the difference in shot patterns between three shots and five shots, emphasizing precision and accuracy in shooting.",
    "page: 222, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix E  \nE-8 \nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nMARKING THE SHOT GROUP \nE-21. If possible, shot groups should be marked using different colored markers so the \nfirer can track their progress. Figure E-5 shows a technique for marking shot groups on \na zero target. This technique allows the firer and coach to track their progress throughout \nthe grouping and zeroing phase.  \nE-22. All sight adjustments are from the center of the group, called the mean point of \nimpact (MPI), and not from the location of a single shot. When using five-shot group, a \nsingle shot that is outside of the rest of the group should not be counted in the group for \nsight adjustment purposes.  \nNote. This figure depicts the color variations in shades of gray. \n \nFigure E-5.

The color \nof the first group is noted by placing a line with that marker next to the 1 on the right \nside of the zero target. Groups are fired and marked until they are consistently in the \nsame location. \nE-24. Each sight adjustment is annotated in the same color as the group that was just \nfired.  \nCOACHING \nE-25. Coaching is the process of having another Soldier observe the firer during the \nfiring process to look for shooting errors that the firer themselves may not consciously \nknow they are making. \nTYPES OF COACHES \nE-26. Firing a rifle properly requires the consistent and proper application of the \nelements of employment. It is about doing the right thing, the same way, every shot. The \nsmall arms trainer is also the validation point for any questions during employment \ntraining. In most cases, once group training is completed, it will be the firer’s \nresponsibility to realize and correct his own firing errors but this process can be made \neasier through the use of a coach. \nE-27. Two types of coaches exist, the experienced coach and the peer coach. Although \neach should execute coaching the same way, experienced coaches have a more thorough \nunderstanding of employment and should have more knowledge and practice in firing \nthan the Soldiers they are coaching. Knowledge and skill does not necessarily come with \nrank therefore Soldiers serving as experienced coaches should be carefully selected for \ntheir demonstrated firing ability and their ability to convey information to firers of \nvarying experience levels. \nEXPERIENCED COACHES \nE-28. Experienced coaches are generally in shorter supply throughout the Army and are \ngenerally outnumbered by less skilled firers. This lack of experienced coaches usually \nleads to one experienced coach watching multiple firers dependent upon the table or \nperiod of employment being fired. It often helps the experienced coach to make notes of \nerrors they observe in shooters and discuss them after firing that group. It is often \ndifficult for the coach to remember the errors that they observe in each and every firer.  \nPEER COACHES \nE-29. Using a peer coach, although generally not as effective as using an experienced \ncoach, is still a very useful technique. The advantage of using a peer coach is two-fold: \na peer coach may use their limited knowledge of employment to observe the firer when \nan experienced coach is not available or is occupied with another firer and can either \ntalk the firer through the shooting errors that they have observed or bring any observed \nshooting errors to the attention of the experienced coach. The other advantage of using \na peer coach is that the peer coach themselves, through the act of coaching, may be able \nto observe mistakes made by the firer and learn from them before making the mistakes \n\n",
    "page: 224, manual name: riflecarbine\nAppendix E \nE-10\nTC 3-22.9 \n13 May 2016 \nthemselves. Many people grasp instruction more deeply when they are coaching others \nthan when they are simply told to do something. \nNote. Peer coaches can be limited by their level of training. \nE-30. Except for aiming, the coach can observe most of the important aspects of the\nelements of employment. To determine the unobservable errors of shooting the coach\nand the firer must have an open dialog and there must be a relaxed environment for\nlearning. The firer cannot be hesitant to ask questions of the coach and the coach must\nnot become a stressor during firing. The coach must have the ability to safely move\naround the firer to properly observe. There is no one ideal coaching position. The\nfollowing section will discuss the elements of shooting and how best to observe them as\na coach.\nSTABILIZE \nE-31. For the coach to observe how stable the shooter is, they may have to move to\ndifferent sides of the shooter. To observe the shooter’s non-firing elbow (to ensure it\nmakes contact with the ground), the coach will need to be on the shooter’s non-firing\nside. To observe the cant of the weapon (the sights on the weapon should be pointing\ntowards 12 o’clock position, not 11 or 1 o’clock positions), the coach will need to watch\nthe relationship of the front sight to the barrel from behind the shooter. The coach should\nlook for all the other aspects of good positions as outlined in chapter 6 of this publication.\nThe coach should also observe the total amount of weapon movement on recoil. A good\nstable position will have minimal movement under recoil.\nAIMING \nE-32. Determining the aspects of the firer’s aiming (sight picture, sight alignment, point\nof focus) requires dialogue between the firer and the coach. Often, a shooter will not\nrealize his aiming errors until he discovers them on his own. The only method a coach\nhas to observe aiming errors is to use of an M16 sighting device (A2, left and right,\nDVC-T 7-84), but this device can only be used on rifles with carrying handle sights.\nWithout the use of a sighting device, the coach must rely on drawings, discussions, or\nthe use of an M15A1 aiming card (DVC-T 07-26) to determine where the firer is aiming\non the target, his focus point during firing (which should be the front sight), and where\nhis front sight was at the moment of firing in relation to the rear sight aperture and the\npoint of aim on the target. The technique of having the firer call his shots should also be\nused. This technique involves calling the point on the target where the sights were\nlocated at the moment of firing and matching the point called with the impact locations\non the target. Calling the shot helps the firer learn to focus on the front sight during the\nentire firing process.\nE-33. When optics are being used, the shooter can tell the coach where he was holding.\nThis is of particular importance with the RCO. Coaches must insure the 300m aim point\nis used when zeroing at 25-m.\n\n",
    "page: 225, manual name: riflecarbine\nZeroing \n31 August 2017 \nTC 3-22.9, C2 \nE-11 \nCONTROL \nE-34. The ideal position to observe trigger squeeze is from the non-firing side because \nthe coach will have a better view of the speed of pull, finger position on the trigger, and \nrelease or pressure on the trigger after firing. The coach can look from behind the shooter \nto observe the barrel for lateral movement caused by slapping the trigger during firing.  \nCOACHING FACTORS \nE-35. All firing happens at the weapon. This means that the coach should be focused \nsolely on the shooter during firing and not on what is happening down range. \nE-36. There is no way for a coach to observe only the bullets impact on target and know \nwhat errors the firer made. The coach must watch the shooter during firing to determine \nerrors and use the impacts to confirm their assumptions.  \nE-37. For a coach to properly observe all aspects of firing they must be able to observe \nthe shooter, safely, from both sides and the back. There is no prescribed coaching \nposition. \nE-38. Coaching requires a relaxed atmosphere with open communication between the \nfirer and the coach. \nSHOT GROUP ANALYSIS \nE-39. Shot group analysis involves the firer correlating the shots on paper with the \nmental image of how the shots looked when fired. An accurate analysis of the shot group \ncannot be made by merely looking at the holes in the paper. It is more important to \nobserve the firer than to try and analyze the target. All firing takes place at the weapon, \nand the holes in the paper are only an indicator of where the barrel was pointed when \nthe rifle was fired. When coaches are analyzing groups, they must question the firer \nabout the group to make a determination of what caused the placement of the shots.  \nE-40. For example, if the firer has a tight group – minus one shot that is well outside of \nthe group, the firer should have observed the outlying shot while firing. The firer would \ndiscount this shot when marking their group. (See figure E-6a and figure E-6b.) If a \ncoach is analyzing the group, the firer would tell them that they performed poorly on the \none shot that is out of the group.  \n \n \n\n",

Novice shooters may benefit from not marking their own shot group. When \nmarking a shot group an inexperienced or stressed Soldier may unintentionally make \nmental corrections. These mental corrections along with the mechanical corrections to \ntheir weapon will cause further issues during follow on shot groups. The experienced \nSoldier is less likely to make adjustments to their sight placement along with the \nmechanical changes to the weapon, knowing the zero process is aligning the sights to \nthe location of the impact of the rounds. Having a coach or the employment instructor \nsimply inform the Soldier of mechanical changes needed to the aiming device is an \neffective way to accomplish this method.  \nE-42. Observing the shooter must be accomplished before analyzing the target can \nbecome effective. Bullets strung vertically do not necessarily mean a breathing issue, \nnor do bullets strung horizontally absolutely indicate a trigger squeeze problem. Coaches \nmust learn to identify shooter errors during firing and use the bullet’s impacts on target \nto confirm their observations. There are often several firing errors that can be the cause \nof certain misplacements of impacts. The coach has to realize that bullets only go where \n\n\n[Image page_227_image_1.jpeg]: \n The diagram presents a target grid that outlines the relationship between shot group placement and trigger control/elevation issues. Here’s a summary of the content:\n\n- **Title**: At the top of the diagram, there is a description labeled \"Vertical group, shows\" accompanied by \"Good Trigger Control\" and \"Poor Elevation.\"\n  \n- **Center of the Diagram**: \n  - A crosshair is depicted at the “Mean Point of Impact,” which indicates the intended point where the shots should ideally land.\n\n- **Diagram Elements**: \n  - Several circles and a grid are present, showing various shot placements.\n  - There are identifiable shot group marks within the grid.\n\n- **Probable Causes**: \n  - A list to the right details nine probable causes for the observed shot group pattern:\n    1. Varying rifle butt position shoulder.\n    2. A very low position.\n    3. Position of non-firing elbow wrong.\n    4. Not enough head pressure.\n    5. Poor follow through.\n    6. Changing distance from eye to rear sight.\n    7. Changing sight picture.\n    8. Not concentrating on sight alignment.\n    9. Changing sight alignment.\n\nThis information serves to help shooters understand potential errors contributing to vertical groupings in their shots.",

They key to proper coaching is becoming a shooting DETECTIVE. The coach\nneeds to observe the shooter, question the shooter, look at the evidence down range,\nquestion the shooter again, make assumptions based upon the evidence available, and\nthen act upon his assumptions. The coach and shooter must have a free and open dialog\nwith each other in a relaxed atmosphere. Remember if a Soldier learns to shoot poorly\nthey will only be capable of shooting poorly.\nDisplacement of Shots Within a Group (Flyers) \nE-44. The capability of the weapon to shoot groups varies dependent on the number of\nrounds fired through the barrel over its lifetime. The average expected group size is\n1 inch (approximately 2.5 centimeters) at 25 meters; some guns may shoot slightly larger\nthan this. If a shooter is firing groups larger than a normal group size the next step should\nbe to have a known skilled shooter attempt to fire and group with the shooter’s weapon.\nIf a proven skilled shooter is able to fire groups of the normal size it is most likely an\nissue with the original shooter. If however the skilled shooter cannot fire within the\naccepted group size there may be something wrong with the gun or barrel.\nE-45. When looking at groups where there are one to two shots away from the group\nbody (one shot away for a three round group, one or two shots away for a five round\ngroup), the coach must look objectively at the overall consistency of group placement.\nA bad shot or group might not indicate a poor grasp of the elements; every shooter will\nhave a bad shot now and again, and some shooters may even have a bad group now and\nagain. Coaches need to use their experience and determine whether or not the firer had\na bad shot, a bad group, or doesn’t have a clear grasp of the elements and take the\nnecessary steps to get the shooter to the end-state. The coach may have the firer shoot\nagain and ignore the bad group or bad shot, instead hoping that the new group matches\nup with the previous shot groups or the coach may need to pull the shooter off the line\nand cover the basic elements. Contrary to popular belief, having a firer shoot over and\nover again in one sitting, until the firer GETS IT RIGHT is not a highly effective\ntechnique.\nBullets Dispersed Laterally on Target \nE-46. Bullets displaced in this manner could be caused by a lateral movement of the\nbarrel due to an unnatural placement of the trigger finger on the trigger. Reasons for this\ncould include—\n\nThe shooter may be slightly misaligning the sights to the left and right.\n\nThe shooter may have the sights aligned properly but may have trouble\nkeeping the target itself perfectly centered on the tip of the front sight.\n\nShooter may be closing eyes at the moment of firing or flinching.\nBullets Dispersed Vertically on Target \nE-47. Bullets displaced in a vertical manner could be caused by the following:\n\n",
    "page: 229, manual name: riflecarbine\nZeroing \n31 August 2017 \nTC 3-22.9, C2 \nE-15 \n \nShooter may be misaligning the front sight in the rear sight aperture \nvertically. May be caused by the shooter watching the target instead of the \nfront sight. Happens more frequently from less stable positions (kneeling, \nunsupported positions) due to the natural movement of the weapon. \n \nShooter may have trouble seeing the target and keeping the tip of the front \nsight exactly centered vertically on the target. Coach may consider using a \nlarger target or a non-standard aiming point such as a 5-inch circle. Many \nshooters find it easier to find the center of a circle than a man shaped target. \n \nShooter may not have good support, which causes him to readjust their \nposition every shot and settle with the sights slightly misaligned. \n \nShooter may be flinching or closing eyes at the moment of firing. \n \nShooter may be breathing while firing the rifle. (This is not normally the \ncase, most shooters instinctively hold their breath just before the moment of \nfiring). \nLarge Groups \nE-48. Large groups are most commonly caused by the shooter looking at the target \ninstead of the front sight. This causes the shooter to place the front sight in the center of \nthe target without regard for its location in the rear sight aperture. A small misalignment \nof the sights will result in a large misplacement of shots downrange. \nE-49. Most likely it is not a point of aim issue; most shooters will not fire when their \nproperly aligned sights are pointed all over the target. \nGood Groups That Change Position on the Target \nE-50. When the shooter has good groups but they are located at different positions on \nthe target, there can be a number of reasons. These include the following:  \n \nMay be caused by the shooter properly aligning sights during shooting but \npicking up a different point of aim on the target each time. \n \nMay be caused by the shooter settling into a position with the front sight on \ntarget but the sights misaligned. The shooter maintains the incorrect sight \npicture throughout the group but aligns the sights incorrectly and in a \ndifferent manner during the next group. Tell the firer to focus on the front \nsight and have them check natural point of aim before each group. \n \n \n\n",

The borelight is a visible laser. The purpose of boresighting is to obtain \nan initial setting on the firer’s sights, optics, and/or night equipment (aiming \nlights and TWS) to enable the firer to hit the 25m zero live-fire target when \nstarting the zero process, resulting in efficient use of range time. Borelighting \nis conducted prior to live-fire zeroing. It is not a substitute for live-fire \nzeroing. \nF-1. The boresight target shows the desired relationship between the bore of the\nweapon and the firer’s aiming point, which varies with the weapon/sight system\ncombination. Different symbols are used for designating different sights/optics, and so\nforth. All borelighting is done at 10 meters.  This is a dry-fire exercise.  Sight settings\nbased on borelight procedures must be verified with live-fire zero at 25 meters.\nF-2. A blank, reproducible 10-meter target offset (figure F-2 on page F-3) and an\nexample of each weapon configuration (figure F-3 on page F-4, figure F-4 on page F-9,\nand figure F-5 on page F-10) are provided. The M16A2 300-meter zeroing target is used\nfor 25-meter zeroing with all weapon configurations, except when zeroing with iron\nsights.\nMARKING 10-METER TARGET OFFSETS \nF-3.
