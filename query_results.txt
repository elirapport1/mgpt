Perform Immediate Action 
8-35. To perform immediate action, the Soldier instinctively: 
 
Hears the hammer fall with an audible “click.” 
 
Taps the bottom of the magazine firmly. 
 
Rapidly pulls the charging handle and releases to extract / eject the previous 
cartridge and feed, chamber, and lock a new round. 
 
Reassess by continuing the shot process. 
Note. If a malfunction continues to occur with the same symptoms, the 
Soldier will remove the magazine and insert a new loaded magazine, then 
repeat the steps above. 
Perform Remedial Action 
8-36. To perform remedial action, the Soldier must have a clear understanding of where 
the weapon failed during the cycle of function. Remedial action executed when one of 
the following conditions exist: 
 
Immediate action does not work after two attempts. 
 
The trigger refuses to be squeezed. 
 
The trigger feels like “mush” when squeezed. 
8-37. When one of these three symptoms exist, the Soldier looks into the chamber area 
through the ejection port to quickly assess the type of malfunction. Once identified, the 
Soldier executes actions to “reduce” the symptom by removing the magazine and 
attempting to clear the weapon. Once complete, visually inspect the chamber area, bolt 
face, and charging handle. Then, complete the actions for the identified symptom: 
 
Stove pipe – Grasp case and attempt to remove, cycle weapon and attempt to 
fire. If this fails, pull charging handle to the rear while holding case. 
 
Double-feed - the Soldier must remove the magazine, clear the weapon, 
confirm the chamber area is clear, secure a new loaded magazine into the 
magazine well, and chamber and lock a round. 
 
Bolt override – Remove magazine. Pull charging handle as far rearward as 
possible. Strike charging handle forward. If this fails, pull charging handle to 
the rear a second time, use tool or finger to hold the bolt to the rear, sharply 
send charging handle forward.

Note. When malfunctions occur in combat, the Soldier must announce 
STOPPAGE or another similar term to their small unit, quickly move to a 
covered location, and correct the malfunction as rapidly as possible. If the 
threat is too close to the Soldier or friendly forces, and the Soldier has a 
secondary weapon, the Soldier should immediately transition to secondary to 
defeat the target prior to correcting the malfunction. 
RULES FOR CORRECTING A MALFUNCTION 
8-34. To clear a malfunction, the Soldier must—

Apply Rule #1. Soldiers must remain coherent of their weapon and continue
to treat their weapon as if it is loaded when correcting malfunctions.

Apply Rule #2. Soldiers must ensure the weapon’s orientation is appropriate
for the tactical situation and not flag other friendly forces when correcting
malfunctions.

Apply Rule #3. Take the trigger finger off the trigger, keep it straight along
the lower receiver placed outside of the trigger guard.

Do not attempt to place the weapon on SAFE (unless otherwise noted).
Most stoppages will not allow the weapon to be placed on safe because the
sear has been released or the weapon is out of battery. Attempting to place
the weapon on SAFE will waste time and potentially damage the weapon.

Treat the symptom. Each problem will have its own specific symptoms. By
reacting to what the weapon is “telling” the Soldier, they will be able to
quickly correct the malfunction.

Maintain focus on the threat. The Soldier must keep their head and eyes
looking downrange at the threat, not at the weapon. If the initial corrective
action fails to correct the malfunction, the Soldier must be able to quickly
move to the next most probable corrective action.

Look last. Do not look and analyze the weapon to determine the cause of the
malfunction. Execute the drill that has the highest probability of correcting
the malfunction.

Check the weapon. Once the malfunction is clear and the threat is
eliminated, deliberately check the weapon when in a covered location for any
potential issues or contributing factors that caused the malfunction and
correct them.

CORRECTING MALFUNCTIONS 
8-38. Figure 8-4 below provides a simple mental flow chart to rapidly overcome 
malfunctions experienced during the shot process.

[Image page_150_image_1.jpeg]: 
 The diagram outlines procedures following a malfunction in a firearm, specifically addressing situations where there is no bang when the trigger is pulled.

1. **Initial Condition**:
   - **NO BANG**
   - Two paths are indicated based on conditions following a "click".

2. **If CLICK**:
   - Yes leads to **Perform Immediate Action**
     - Proceed to **Tap Rack Reassess**.
     - End with **Ready**.

3. **If MUSH**:
   - No leads to **Perform Remedial Action**
     - Next step: **Look / Identify**.
     - Followed by **Reduce**.
       - Four potential issues to identify:
         - **Stove Pipe**
         - **Double Feed**
         - **Bolt Override**
         - **Charging Handle Impingement**
     - Concludes with **Ready**.

The flowchart emphasizes immediate and remedial actions to ensure continued readiness of the firearm in the event of a malfunction.
