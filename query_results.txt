Perform Immediate Action 
8-35. To perform immediate action, the Soldier instinctively: 
 
Hears the hammer fall with an audible “click.” 
 
Taps the bottom of the magazine firmly. 
 
Rapidly pulls the charging handle and releases to extract / eject the previous 
cartridge and feed, chamber, and lock a new round. 
 
Reassess by continuing the shot process. 
Note. If a malfunction continues to occur with the same symptoms, the 
Soldier will remove the magazine and insert a new loaded magazine, then 
repeat the steps above. 
Perform Remedial Action 
8-36. To perform remedial action, the Soldier must have a clear understanding of where 
the weapon failed during the cycle of function. Remedial action executed when one of 
the following conditions exist: 
 
Immediate action does not work after two attempts. 
 
The trigger refuses to be squeezed. 
 
The trigger feels like “mush” when squeezed. 
8-37. When one of these three symptoms exist, the Soldier looks into the chamber area 
through the ejection port to quickly assess the type of malfunction. Once identified, the 
Soldier executes actions to “reduce” the symptom by removing the magazine and 
attempting to clear the weapon. Once complete, visually inspect the chamber area, bolt 
face, and charging handle. Then, complete the actions for the identified symptom: 
 
Stove pipe – Grasp case and attempt to remove, cycle weapon and attempt to 
fire. If this fails, pull charging handle to the rear while holding case. 
 
Double-feed - the Soldier must remove the magazine, clear the weapon, 
confirm the chamber area is clear, secure a new loaded magazine into the 
magazine well, and chamber and lock a round. 
 
Bolt override – Remove magazine. Pull charging handle as far rearward as 
possible. Strike charging handle forward. If this fails, pull charging handle to 
the rear a second time, use tool or finger to hold the bolt to the rear, sharply 
send charging handle forward.

Note. When malfunctions occur in combat, the Soldier must announce 
STOPPAGE or another similar term to their small unit, quickly move to a 
covered location, and correct the malfunction as rapidly as possible. If the 
threat is too close to the Soldier or friendly forces, and the Soldier has a 
secondary weapon, the Soldier should immediately transition to secondary to 
defeat the target prior to correcting the malfunction. 
RULES FOR CORRECTING A MALFUNCTION 
8-34. To clear a malfunction, the Soldier must—

Apply Rule #1. Soldiers must remain coherent of their weapon and continue
to treat their weapon as if it is loaded when correcting malfunctions.

Apply Rule #2. Soldiers must ensure the weapon’s orientation is appropriate
for the tactical situation and not flag other friendly forces when correcting
malfunctions.

Apply Rule #3. Take the trigger finger off the trigger, keep it straight along
the lower receiver placed outside of the trigger guard.

Do not attempt to place the weapon on SAFE (unless otherwise noted).
Most stoppages will not allow the weapon to be placed on safe because the
sear has been released or the weapon is out of battery. Attempting to place
the weapon on SAFE will waste time and potentially damage the weapon.

Treat the symptom. Each problem will have its own specific symptoms. By
reacting to what the weapon is “telling” the Soldier, they will be able to
quickly correct the malfunction.

Maintain focus on the threat. The Soldier must keep their head and eyes
looking downrange at the threat, not at the weapon. If the initial corrective
action fails to correct the malfunction, the Soldier must be able to quickly
move to the next most probable corrective action.

Look last. Do not look and analyze the weapon to determine the cause of the
malfunction. Execute the drill that has the highest probability of correcting
the malfunction.

Check the weapon. Once the malfunction is clear and the threat is
eliminated, deliberately check the weapon when in a covered location for any
potential issues or contributing factors that caused the malfunction and
correct them.

8-31. Immediate action can correct rudimentary failures during the cycle of function: 
 
Failure to fire – is when a round is locked into the chamber, the weapon is 
ready to fire, the select switch is placed on SEMI or BURST / AUTO, and 
the trigger is squeezed, the hammer falls (audible click), and the weapon does 
not fire. 
 
Failure to feed – is when the bolt carrier assembly is expected to move return 
back into battery but is prevented from moving all the way forward. A clear 
gap can be seen between the bolt carrier assembly and the forward edge of 
the ejection port. This failure may cause a stove pipe or a double feed (see 
below). 
 
Failure to chamber – when the round is being fed into the chamber, but the 
bolt carrier assembly does not fully seat forward, failing to chamber the round 
and lock the bolt locking lugs with the barrel extension’s corresponding lugs. 
 
Failure to extract – when either automatically or manually, the extractor 
loses its grip on the cartridge case or the bolt seizes movement rearward 
during extraction that leaves the cartridge case partially removed or fully 
seated. 
 
Failure to eject – occurs when, either automatically or manually, a cartridge 
case is extracted from the chamber fully, but does not leave the upper receiver 
through the ejection port. 
8-32. Remedial action requires the Soldier to quickly identify one of four issues and 
apply a specific technique to correct the malfunction. Remedial action is required to 
correct the following types of malfunctions or symptoms: 
 
Immediate action fails to correct symptom – when a malfunction occurred 
that initiated the Soldier to execute immediate action and multiple attempts 
failed to correct the malfunction. A minimum of two cycles of immediate 
action should have been completed; first, without a magazine change, and the 
second with a magazine change. 
 
Stove pipe – can occur when either a feeding cartridge or an expended 
cartridge case is pushed sideways during the cycle of function causing that 
casing to stop the forward movement of the bolt carrier assembly and lodge 
itself between the face of the bolt and the ejection port.  
 
Double feed – occurs when a round is chambered and not fired and a 
subsequent round is being fed without the chamber being clear. 
 
Bolt override – is when the bolt fails to push a new cartridge out of the 
magazine during feeding or chambering, causing the bolt to ride on top of the 
cartridge. 
 
Charging handle impingement – when a round becomes stuck between the 
bolt assembly and the charging handle where the charging handle is not in 
the forward, locked position.  
8-33. Although there are other types of malfunctions or disruptions to the cycle of 
function, those listed above are the most common. Any other malfunction will require 
additional time to determine the true point of failure and an appropriate remedy.
